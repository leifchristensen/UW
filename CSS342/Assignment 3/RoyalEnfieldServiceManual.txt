Observe the following points without fail, when dismantling and 
reassembling Motor-cycle parts. 
Be sure to replace packings, gaskets, circlips. '0' rings and cotter pins 
with new ones, for 'safe riding'. 
Tighten bolts & nuts starting from the larger diameter ones to the smaller 
diameter and from inside to outside diagonally, with specified tightening 
torque. 
Use always genuine spares and recommended grade of oils only. 
When using a torque wrench for checking, always loosen the bolt or nut 
by half turn and then tighten to the specified torque. Never use torque 
wrench for loosening a bolt or nut. 
WORKSHOP MANUAL - BULLET 
PREFACE 
We take pleasure in releasing this Maintenance Manual as a guide to good 
service. Most of the servicing can well done by the average owner. Numerous 
diagrammatic Sketches and photo illustrations have been introduced for better 
understanding. However for an owner who feels uncertain of his ability to, undertake 
any stripping and re-building for a major overhaul, we strongly recommend that the 
work be done by an authorised 'ENFIELD DEALER/DISTRIBUTOR. Needless to mention 
that the use of proper service maintenance tools and genuine Enfield spares will ensure 
best results. 
Whilst every care is taken to ensure that the information in this manual is correct, 
no liability can be accepted by Royal Enfield or the publisher for loss, damage 
or injury caused due to errors or omissions in the informations given. 
PRECAUTIONS AND GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
BUYING SPARE PARTS 
When ordering spare parts for your Motorcycle it is advisable to deal direct with 
the Enfield official dealer/distributor, who should be able to supply most of the 
parts ex-stock. 
Always quote the Engine Number and Frame Number and description of part required. 
It is advisable to indicate the colour scheme especially while ordering parts for frame, 
side panels,tank, mudguards, etc., 
USE ALWAYS GENUINE "ENFIELD" SPARES 
2 
ROUTINE MAINTENANCE 
Introduction 
Periodic routine maintenance is a continuous process that commences immediately after 
the machine is used. It must be carried out at specified mileage recordings, or an a calendar 
basis if the machine is not used frequently. 
Maintenance should be regarded as an insurance policy, to keep the machine in peak 
condition and to ensure long, trouble free service. 
The various maintenance tasks are described under their respective mileage and period. 
The intervals between the various maintenance tasks serves only as a guide, As the machine 
gets older or used under particularly adverse conditions, it would be advisable to reduce the 
period between each check. 
For ease of reference each service operation is described in detail under the relevant heading. 
In order to carryout the routine maintenance tasks, a good selection of general workshop tools 
is absolutely essential. 
Included in the kit must be a range of metric ring or combination spanners, a selection of 
phillips head screw drivers and pair of circlip pliers. 
No special tools are required for the normal routine maintenance tasks. The tools contained 
in the tool kit supplied with every new machine will prove adequate for each task, or if they are 
not available, the tools found in the average household will usually suffice. 
3 
Daily 
A daily check of the Motorcycle is essential both from mechanical and safety aspects. It is a 
good idea to develop this checking procedure in a specific sequence so that it will ultimately 
become as instinctive as actually riding the machine. Done properly, this simple checking 
sequence will give advanced warning of impending mechanical failures and conditions which 
may jeopardize the safety of the rider. 
- Clean the motorcycle with a clean cloth. 
- Check engine oil level,using the dipstick provided in the oil tank cap. Maintain oil level 
upto 'H' mark. If necessary top up oil to the required level. 
- Check proper operations of all controls viz. clutch, accelerator, brakes, all lights and 
horns. 
- Check tyre pressure, with a pressure gauge. Check tyre pressure when the tyres are 
cold. It is worth purchasing a small pocket pressure gauge which can be relied upon, to 
give consistent readings than garage forecourt gauges which tend to be less dependable. 
- Tyre Pressure Front: 32 PSI - Rear: 36 PSI. 
- Check tyres for foreign materials and remove them to prevent possible punctures. 
Check for adequate fuel in the petrol tank, for the journey planned. 
- Check for proper charging of the battery after starting the machine. 
Monthly - 300 Miles/500 Kms 
Check oil levels - engine & clutch 
Check contact breaker gap and adjust if necessary 
Check and adjust tappet clearance if necessary 
Check clutch, throttle and front brake cables and adjust if excessive play noticed 
Lubricate rear chain 
Adjust front & rear brakes 
Check wheel rims, for excessive runout, breakage of spokes and tyres for cracks or cuts. 
Check condition of battery and electrolyte level, and top up with distilled water upto the 
level provided. 
4 
Tri monthly - 3000 miles/5000 kms 
- Clean, and adjust plug gap or replace spark plug. 
- Check and service contact breaker points. 
- Check and adjust Ignition timing. 
- Check and adjust valve tappet clearance. 
- Clean airfilter. 
- Clean, tune up carburettor. 
- Clean fuel tap gauze. 
Clean fuel tank and fuel lines. 
- Check and adjust clutch. 
- Adjust front & rear brakes 
- Check front fork oil level. 
- Check all electrical connections and functions of head light, trafficator, horn, speedometer, 
etc. 
Six monthly - 6000 Miles/10,000 kms 
Carry out all the operations mentioned for Tri monthly service and check the 
following: 
- Change oil-engine & clutch. 
- Clean or replace oil filter 
- Change front fork oil 
- Check front & rear brake linings and replace if necessary 
- Check for play in steering head bearings and adjust 
- Check operation of steering lock and lubricate if necessary 
- Check operation of side stand and condition of spring.

CYLINDER HEAD 
ENGINE 
Decarbonising: 
After a few thousands of Kms. of run the carbon bUild up in the engine will cause general 
falling off in power, accompanied by increased fuel consumption and starting trouble. 
Decarbonising will normally be necessary approximately every 8,000 Kms. and this can be 
carried out without removing the engine from the frame. The mileage between decarbonising 
will vary from machine to machine depending upon the type of usage. A machine used for 
frequent short journeys will need more attention than one which is used for fast long distance 
touring. 
1. Removal of the petrol tank 
Close the petrol tap. Disconnect the fuel hose from petrol tap end. 
Remove the two studs which holds the petrol tank to the frame and pull the tank upwards. 
2. Removal of the Cylinder head 
Remove the engine steady eye bolt. 
Disconnect the high tension lead from the spark plug. Remove rocker oil pipe. 
Remove the exhaust pipe and silencer. 
Remove the air filter by undoing the bolts on the sides of the air filter body. 
Push the carburettor back clear of the studs after removing the fixing nuts. 
Remove the rocker box covers. 
Remove the decompressor cable from the lever end of the handle bar (LH side) 
Crank the engine until both valves are closed. (Keep in Compression stroke). 
Remove the rocker 
arms and bearings 
completely after 
removing the four 3/16" 
nuts on each. 
Lift out the push rods 
both inlet & exhaust. 
Remove the six 
cylinder head nuts & 
washers. 
Lift the cylinder head 
off the barrel, tapping it 
genly beneath the 
exhaust and inlet ports 
with a wooden mallet. 
Do Not tap the fins. 
14 
VALVE SPRING COMPRESSOR 
3. Removal of Cylinder and Piston 
Slacken the two clamp nuts on top of the crank-case neck. 
Remove the 1/4" nut above the tappet chest and lift the barrel 
REMOVAL OF PISTON 
Remove the circlip retaining the gudgeon pin on the timing 
side of piston taking care not to drop the circlip into the crank 
case. 
Extract the gudgeon pin using special Tool PED 2015 
(with adaptor if necessary), so that the pin and the piston 
may be replaced the same way round, i.e., split skirt to the 
front. 
During this operation put a piece of clean rag in the top of the crankcase to prevent foreign matter 
getting in. Finally cover the crankcase with a clean cloth to prevent ingress of dust and dirt. 
4. Removal of Valves 
To remove the valves from the cylinder head, 
first lift off the end caps from the valve stems. If 
this has stuck, it can be removed by a screw 
driver. Using compressing tool PED 2018 ST 
compress the valve springs and remove the split 
collars from the valve tip. Slacken back the 
compressing tools and release the springs. 
Withdraw the valve and place its springs, top 
spring collar, bottom collar, the end cap and 
split conical collars together in order that they 
may be reassembled with the valve from which 
they were removed. 
If the valve will not slide easily through the 
valve guide, remove any slight burrs on the end 
of the valve stem with a carborundum stone or 
by using a fine Jeweller's file to remove any 
sharp edge or burr. If the burrs are not removed 
and the valve is forced out, the valve guide may 
be damaged.

CRANKSHAFT BIG END BEARING 
5. Decarbonising the Cylinder head - Combustion Chamber 
Remove carbon from the valves, 
ports and combustion chamber by 
scrapping. Take care not to cause 
any damage to the valve faces or 
valve seat inserts. Scrape 
gently to avoid scoring the cylinder 
head. 
DO NOT, under and 
circumstance, use caustic soda o] 
potash for the removal ,of carbon 
from aluminium alloy. 
Remove the piston rings 
carefully. For cleaning the grooves 
in the piston, a piece of broken 
piston ring thrust into a woodei 
handle and filed to a chisel point 
can be used: 
CYLINDER HEAD 
6. Piston and Rings 
If the piston rings are in good condition they can be put back, taking care to fit them in their 
original grooves and the same way up. If the rings show brown or black patches or if their 
gaps, are more than specified service limits (Page 79), when in position in the barrel, new rings 
should be fitted. The correct gap for new rings is given in the technical specifications (pages 
6 & 8 ) for 350 and 500cc. The gap should be measured in the least worn part of the cylinder 
which will be found at the top or bottom of the bore. 
Only For 350cc: 
The original size of the cylinder bore is 2.751" (690875mm). If the wear at any point in the 
bore exceeds .008" the cylinder should be rebored to .020" and an oversize piston fitted. (It 
should be rebored to .040" after a further .008"wear). Piston sizes available are .020" and .040" 
oversize. 
The original side clearance between the piston rings 
and grooves is .003". If the grooves show a wear of .005" 
the piston should be replaced. 
7. Big end bearing inspection 
Examine the condition of the big end while the piston is 
removed. About .010" - .020' end float is permissible and 
it will be possible to rock the connecting rod slightly. The 
big end has a floating bush with an original clearance of 
approximately .003" However, if a DEFINITE up and down 
play can be felt, engine should be stripped further to have 
the big end renewed.

8. Valves, Valve Guides and springs 
VALVE & SPRING ASSEMBLY 
Wear on the valve stems can be seen on examination 
and if a definite step has formed, the valves should be 
renewed. Before replacing the valves, they must be 
ground on to their seats, if good faces are not formed 
with a reasonable amount of grinding, the seats must 
be cut with a cutter (included angle 90°) and the valve 
refaced in a universal grinder. Do not attempt to form 
good seats by an excessive amount of grinding. This 
will cause pocketing and restrict the flow of gases. If a 
pocket has already been formed this must be removed 
by cutting with a valve seat cutter larger in diameter 
than the valve head. 
Test the valve guides for wear by trying the fit of a 
new valve in them. Both valves should be quite free, 
but the exhaust valve has more clearance (.002") than 
inlet valve. 
To remove the valve guides from the head, two 
special tools are required which can be easily made. 
The first is a piece of tube with an internal bore of not 
less than 7/8". The second is a mandrel about 4" long 
made from 9/16" diameter bar with the end turned 
down to 1/3" 
diameter for a 
length of 1/2". 
Support the 
cylinder head on the tube which fits over the c.. 1,1ar of the 
valve guide. Using the mandrel, force the guide out of the 
head with a hand press or by using a hammer. 
To fit a new guide, support the head at the correct angle 
and use a hand press and the same mandrel. If a hand 
press is not available, the guide can be replaced using a 
hammer and a mandrel, to prevent damage to the guide. 
Check the length of the valve springs which are 
originally 2.020" and 2.095" for the inner and outer springs 
respectively. If these have reached the specified service 
limits, they should be renewed. 
9. Decompressor 
If the decompressor holds compression and operates 
freely, there is no need to interfere with it except to remove 
the carbon from the head of the valve. If the valve is leaking, 
it will be necessary to regrind it on its seat. This can be 
done without completely dismantling it. Having 
disconnected the control cable from the handle bar, 
unscrew the decompressor from the cylinder head. 
Compress the spring and remove the spring cap. Unscrew 
the adjusting screw and locknut from the cable block and 
pull the cable sideways out of the block. Push the spring. 
17 
upwards and pull the cable nipple out of the body, It.will now be possible to remove the cable 
and nipple through the spring, leaving the decompressor body and spring detached from the 
control cable. 
The spring and the cap should now be replaced. The valve may be ground in by applying a 
thin coating of grinding paste on the seat of the valve and twisting it to and fro by means of the 
cable block at its upper end and occasionally lifting the valve from its seat. Do not rotate the 
valve through a complete revolution before lifting, as this will groove the seat. After grinding, 
wash the whole assembly thoroughly in petrol, opening and shutting the valve while doing so. 
Make sure that all traces of grinding paste have been removed. If the paste should get into the 
cylinder serious damage would be caused. 
If the valve'shows a tendency to stick-up in the body but otherwise is satisfactory, this can 
be cured by washing in petrol, though in this case it will not be necessary to disconnect the 
control cable.. 
If the decompressor valve is badly burnt or bent it must be replaced. 
10. Re-assembly after Decarbonising 
Before building up the engine, see that all parts are scrupulously clean and place them on 
a clean tray, work bench or over a clean sheet of paper. While re-assembling it is advisable to 
fit a new gasket between the cylinder barrel and the crankcase. 
Smear clean oil over the piston and space the ring gaps. The second ring is a taper ring and 
is marked TOP on the upper surface. 
WARNING: This mark should be on top when fitted. Reversing the ring will result in pumping 
of oil into the cylinder and consequent smoking. 
Place the piston over the connecting rod small end ensuring the split skirt is facing the 
front and insert the gudgeon pin. Secure the gudgeon pin with the circlips. Oil the cylinder 
bore and gently push barrel over the piston while keeping the rings compressed in their grooves 
and seat it gently on the barrel gasket. Refit the 1/4" nut above the timing chest. 
When fitting the head again, apply jointing compound sparingly on both sides of the gasket, 
Replace the six nuts and tighten them progressively and diagonally from one side to the other 
to prevent distortion. 
WARNING: Excess compound may block oilways. 
Place the push rods with the adjustable parts downwards. The shorter pushrod is the Inlet. 
Ensure valve stem caps are fixed on the valve stems. Position the rockers and bearings, making 
sure that the oil feed holes are at the bottom and that the caps and bases are in line when 
tightened down. Adjust the push rods after ensuring piston is in 'TDC' on compression stroke. 
The silencer could be cleaned of carbon using a hot caustic soda solution, if necessary. 
NOTE: The cylinder head and base nuts should be checked again for tightness, after the 
engine has been run long enough to get it thoroughly warm. Tighten the clamp nuts on crankcase 
finally. For torque tightening or cy. head nuts please refer torque chart on PageNo. 100

OIL FILTER ELEMENT 
SERVICE OPERATION - 
WITH ENGINE ON FRAME 
1. Removal of the Timing cover 
First place a tray under the engine to hold the oil which will escape when the cover is 
removed. 
Remove the exhaust pipe and silencer. Remove ten screws from the timing cover, taking 
care not to lose the sealing washers, one for each screw. 
NOTE: When removing or refitting the timing cover it is important that the engine is gently 
cranked. This will prevent damage of the pump worm or the pump spindle. 
Draw off the timing cover, tapping it lightly if necessary with a wooden mallet. 
While refitting the timing cover ensure that the joint washer is correctly located over the oil 
holes, using a little grease (not compound) to hold it in position. 
Ensure that the cork plug is in position in the hole in the pump worm. If the plug is damaged 
it should be renewed to ensure oil flow to the big end bearing. 
NOTE: The filter chamber should be filled with clean oil before the timing cover is refitted. 
Ensure proper functioning of oil pump by checking oil flow at rocker ripe union when the 
engine is running at slow speed. Slacken the oil pipe banjo union to see the oil-flow and clamp 
it again properly. Wipe the oil that has oozed out.

2. Cleaning/Replacement of Oil Filter 
Element - Oil Feed and Return Filters 
The oil filter is located in the timing cover 
immediately below the oil pumps. The felt element 
should be taken out and washed in petrol after 
the first 800 Kms. and subsequently, every 4,000 
Kms. Fit a new element every 8,000 Kms. 
The filter element can be removed by 
unscrewing the nut holding the end cap in 
position. When re-assembling the filter take care 
that no grit or other foreign matter is sticking to 
it. After replacing the filter element it is essential 
to run the engine at idling for about five minutes 
to ensure that oil reaches the big end. If the timing 
cover has been removed, fill the filter chamber 
with clean oil before replacing the cover. 
The feed and return filters are fixed on the 
drain plugs in oil sump and crank case. These 
can be cleaned by rinsing in a solvent and during 
reassembly ensure the filters are not twisted. 
3. Overhauling of Oil feed and return Pumps 
—Remove the timing cover. 
—Remove the end covers from both pumps. 
—Remove the pump discs and plungers. 
—Remove the pump spindle which can be pulled out only from the front or return pump end. 
—Check the fit of the plungers in the pump discs which should be sliding fit and should be 
able to be moved in and out by hand. 
OIL FEED 8 RETURN PUMPS ASSY. 
20 
When matching a plunger in the pump disc, if it is found to be too tight a fit, carefully lap 
the plunger in the pump disc. Using metal polish until it is just free. 
If the pump disc is not seating properly in the timing cover or if a new pump disc is fitted, it 
should be ensured that the pump disc matches properly and has a perfect seating in the 
timing cover. 
Lap the discs in the timing cover with fine metal lapping paste or liquid metal polish using 
special tools PED 2034 ST for feed pump disc and PED 2035 ST for return pump disc, until a 
fine, grey surface is obtained on the pump disc face. 
NOTE: Replacement pump discs have a lip left at the opposite side of the lapped face. The 
purpose of this is to hold the disc, central in the housing during lapping-in. it should be filed 
off before the pump is finally assembled. Care should be taken not to damage the lapped face. 
Wash all components and passages, thoroughly with petrol, after lapping, to remove all 
traces of grinding paste. Check the pump disc springs for fatigue by assembling in the timing 
cover and placing the pump covers in position. The latter should be held 1/8"off the timing 
cover if the springs are correct. The pump spindle should be renewed if excessive wear has 
taken place on the teeth. 
Reassemble the oil pumps, replacing the cover gaskets. Before fitting each cover fill the 
pump chamber with clean oil. Having assembled the pumps, lay the timing cover flat and fill 
the oil ports using an oil can. Turn the pump spindle with a screwdriver in a clockwise 
direction and it can then be checked whether the pumps are operating correctly. Before replacing 
the timing cover on the engine, fill the filter chamber with clean oil and fit the filter element. 
NOTE: With the engine running, the oil feed to the big end can be checked by partially 
unscrewing the feed plug in the timing cover between the oil pumps and the oil return can be 
checked by slackening the rocker pipe banjo bolt on the cylinder head and observing the oil 
flow. 
4. Removal of Pump Worm and Timing Pinion 
Unscrew the pump worm using the hexagon head behind the worm, with special tool PED 
2006. Withdraw the timing pinion using special tool PED 2013. 
CAUTION: The worm nut has a left hand thread. When turned clock wise the worm nut can 
be loosened and when turned anticlockwise the worm nut gets tightened. 
NOTE: When refitting the timing cover ensure that the cork is in position in the worm nut 
and is undamaged. This forms a seal between the oil feed plug and the oil passage in the crank 
shaft, timing side. If necessary this should be replaced and care should be taken to have it 
fitted correctly. 
CAUTION: If this cork is not fitted or damaged, the oil feed to the big end bearing through 
the timing shaft will tend to escape past this point causing starvation of lubrication to the big 
end bearing leading to premature failure of the big end floating bush, engine bearings and 
other parts.

ADJUSTING TAPPETS 
5. Removal of Contact breaker housing. 
Loosen the distributor pinion nut and pull out the distributor pinion off the distributor 
shaft after removing the idler pinions. 
Loosen and remove the three screws which secure the spigotted contact breaker housing 
and seperate from crankcase. Remove the contact breaker cover. Remove the base plate after 
removing the two hex bolts securing it. 
Pull out the contact breaker shaft from the housing. The two sintered bushes provided in 
the housing would have to be replaced only if excessive radial play is noticed on the distributor 
shaft. 
Reassembly is just the reverse process of dismantling but take care to replace the washer 
between the contact breaker housing and the crank case. 
DETAIL OF FELT OIL CLEANER 
6. Valve Timing 
The cams are integral with the cam pinions. They 
have internal sintered iron bushes running on fixed 
spindles in the timing chest. 
The cams and the timing pinion are provided with 
timing marks to set proper valve timing. The 
procedure is detailed below. 
Bring the piston to TDC position. Match the 
exhaust cam (provided with two sets of punch marks) 
with the timing pinion so that the two punch marks 
coincide on both. Match the inlet cam to the exhaust 
cam so that the single punch mark coincide on both. 
Push the cams home towards the crankcase. 
A: MARK ON INLET CAM 
B: MARK ON EXHAUST CAM 
C: MARK ON TIMING PINION 
7. Tappet Adjustment - Cold 
It is very essential to ensure that the valves are closed fully during the closing period of the 
cam. The tappet clearance should be adjusted properly to achieve this and to cater to certain 
amount of thermal expansion of the working 
components. We recommend 'NIL clearance for the 
tappets to be set at cold. Provision for adjustment 
is given at the bottom end of the push rod which 
sits over the tappet. Access to this is by removing 
the tappet cover. 
Proceed as follows for adjustments. Bring the 
piston to TDC at the end of compression stroke, 
so that both the valves are at the closed position. 
This may be ensured by seeing the valve timing 
marks, if the timing cover is open or through 
ammeter needle in its centre position, when 
ignition is switched on. 
22 
Check the push rods. They must rotate thumb free without any up and down play. 
In case the push rods do not rotate freely or if up and down play is noticed, the push rods 
need to be adjusted. 
Loosen the lock nut in the adjuster, by holding the top nut. Thread in or out, the bottam 
adjuster, till the correct push rod freeness is achieved. Retighten the lock nut after adjustments 
are complete. 
CAUTION: If the cylinder head has been disturbed for any attention, ensure proper fitment 
of valve stem caps and rocker bearings before proceeding to tappet adjustment. 
NOTE: Owing to the initial bedding down of the wearing surfaces, the tappets on new 
engines may require adjustment after the first few hundred kilometres of run. 
8. The Clutch - 350cc- and 500 cc 
The 350cc clutch has five driven plates and four driving plates, including the friction disc 
on the sprocket. 
The 500cc clutch is similar to that of 350cc. except that there are six driven plates and five 
driving plates. 
Also the lugs on the clutch sprocket and the splines on clutch centre are longer. 
9. Removal of the Clutch 
Remove the L.H. front foot rest. Place a tray beneath the primary chain case to collect the oil 
in the chain case. Remove the centre nut in the chain case outer and remove the cover. 
To remove the clutch unscrew the clutch spring pins. Lift away the spring cap, springs, 
clutch front plate, clutch pad in main shaft. The assembly of driving and driven clutch plates 
and the clutch retaining spring. The clutch sprocket can then be withdrawn along with the 
chain and engine sprockets (see point 10). 
The clutch centre can be removed only after the engine sprocket, primary chain and the 
clutch sprocket has been removed. 
To remove the clutch centre hold the clutch with a brake bar (Special Tool No. PED 2025) 
and remove the centre retaining nut and washer with a box spanner. The clutch centre can 
then be withdrawn from the shaft using extractor (Special Tool No. PED 2005).

10. Removal of Engine and Clutch sprockets 
Remove the alternator stator by undoing three nuts. The primary chain is endless hence it 
is necessary to remove both the engine and clutch sprockets simultaneously. Remove the 
central hexagon nut securing the alternator rotor, which can then be drawn off, taking care 
not to lose the key. The engine sprocket is mounted on splines and can be removed along with 
the clutch sprocket using extractor PED 2004 ST 
11. Removal of Final Drive Sprocket 
Remove the clutch as described above. Remove the primary chain tensioner. Remove the 
primary chaincase inner by removing three nuts. Remove the folding of the tab washer which 
is provided for locking the final drive sprocket nut. Hold the sprocket and remove the nut (right 
hand thread). The sprocket can then be withdrawn. 
12. Re-assembly of the Clutch Plates 
When re-assembling the clutch plates the following order must be observed. The clutch pad 
must be fitted into the main drive shaft, plain dished plate (dish projecting out wards). 
Friction plate with inserts, plain flat plate. friction plate bonded, plain dished plate (dish 
projecting inwards). friction plate bonded, clutch front plate 3 springs on the clutch centre 
lugs. 
CLUTCH ASSEMBLY 
In the case of 500cc one more plain 
flat plate and one friction plate will also 
have to be fixed after the plate with inserts 
has been assembled. 
The other three springs are located by 
means of bosses on the clutch cap. 
Tighten the spring pins as far as they will 
go. If the clutch lifts unevenly, it is 
probable that one of the springs has taken 
a set, in which case new spring should be 
fitted. 
The friction plate with inserts should 
be renewed if badly worn or when the 
inserts have become loose in their plate. 
The bonded friction plates require renewal 
when worn or charred. (A light change to 
a blackish colour should not be mistaken 
as charred). Excessive or premature wear 
of the plates is due to either running the vehicle at half clutch application or depriving the 
clutch plates of oil, with insufficient or no oil in the clutch chain case. 
13. Primary Chain Adjustment 
Access to the primary chain adjuster is gained by removing the primary chain cover which 
is held in position by a single nut. Before removing the nut, place a tray under the engine to 
collect the oil from the chaincase. 
Beneath the bottom run of the chain is a curved slipper chain tensioner pad on which the 
chain rests. This can be raised or lowered by turning the adjusting screw below the chain 
tensioner pad after having first slackened the locknut. 
25 
PRIMARY CHAIN ADJUSTMENT 
A. ADJ LISTER. 
1 
The chain should be adjusted 
so that there is 1/4" up and 
down movement at the centre of 
the top run of the chain. 
Remember to check the chain 
tension at 3 or 4 places and then 
adjust accordingly. Ensure that 
the chain tensioner pad moves 
freely and the lock nut of the 
adjuster is retightened after 
carrying out the adjustment. The 
chain is to be renewed if its 
length has increased by 3/4" 
than the length of a new chain. 
After replacing the chain 
cover, remember to replenish the 
chaincase with oil (SAE 20) up 
to the level plug in outer chain 
case(approx - Qty.. - 430 to 450 
ml.) 
14. Adjustment of the Clutch control 
It is essential that there should be about 3 to 4mm free movement in the clutch cable, to 
ensure that all the spring pressure is exerted on the plates. 
There are two points of adjustment on the clutch cable. The first is the midway adjuster at 
CLUTCH ADJUSTMENT ON GEAR BOX 
the middle of the cable just above the 
chain case. The adjustment is made by 
screwing the adjuster screw in or out of 
the adjuster body. Tighten the locknut on 
the screwed collar after adjustment has 
been made. 
The other point is at the handle bar 
end. Loosen the lock nut and thread in 
the adjuster to increase play and vice 
versa to reduce play. Tighten lock nut 
after carrying out adjustment. However 
if the adjusters have reached their 
maximum position then the adjustment 
can be carried out in the gear box outer 
cover. Before proceeding on the 
adjustment, turn in both cable adjusters 
to their fully closed position (fully in 
position). 
To make the adjustment, remove the inspection cover, slacken the locknut and turn the 
central screw in, to get the desired free play on the clutch lever at the handle bar end. Tighten 
the locknut after adjustment has been made. 
26 
The stator - a fixed ring with coils 
Wiring carrying power to the 
battery via the rectifier 
Magnets 
The rotor - this revolves inside 
the stator and has magnets across 
its width 
Owing to initial bedding down of the clutch plate inserts, the clutch control may require 
adjustment after the first few hundred Krns with a new machine. This point should therefore 
be examined soon after delivery and adjustment made if necessary. Initially, excessive play in 
the cable can be taken up through midway adjuster and the adjuster at the handle bar end. 
NOTE: The clutch adjuster ball and clutch rod may require cleaning and greasing around 
6000 miles/100001ims of run. To do this, loosen and carefully remove the clutch adjuster 
from its position, taking care not to drop it into the gear box outer cover. 
Start the engine and tilt the motorcycle towards the gear box side, so that the clutch rod 
can be removed. Wash thoroughly, the clutch rod and adjuster and look for chipped or worn 
clutch rod ends and free rotation of the clutch adjuster ball. 
Smear multipurpose grease on the clutch rod and reassemble into the mainshaft. Smear 
grease on the clutch adjuster ball and carefully reassemble in its location. Adjust the adjuster 
to ensure free play is maintained on handle bar end and tighten lock nut. 
15. Fitting the Alternator 
The alternator consists of two parts, the stator and the rotor. The stator is mounted on to 
the primary chaincase inner by three studs and nuts. 
The rotor, which contains the permanent magnet, is mounted on the end of the drive shaft 
and is located by a key and secured by a special nut and spring washer. The designed radial air 
gap between the rotor and the poles of the stator is 0.25mm ( 0.010") and care must be taken 
when refitting to see that it is not less than 0.15mm (0.006'') at any point. 
SINGLE PHASE ALTERNATOR 
27 
Fit the rotor first, making sure that it is located concentrically on the end of the drive shaft. 
Attention must be given to the proper seating of the key. Finally secure the rotor with the 
appropriate washer and nut. 
Having fitted the rotor, the stator may then be fitted on to the chaincase inner with the coil 
connections facing outwards. Replace the shake proof washers and the nuts on the studs and 
tighten gently. Insert six strips (preferably non magnetic material) 0.15mm (0.006") thick and 
25.4mm (1") wide. Check whether the strips are free in position. If one or more of the strips are 
not free, gently tap stator (at the opposite end) to centralise the same such that all the strips 
become free. Tighten the stator nuts and ensure the strips move freely. Gently crank engine, 
recheck the strips are free. Repeat this process at 3 or 4 places and then withdraw the strips. 
16. Function of Breather 
The efficient operation of the breather is of paramount importance to the performance of 
the engine because it acts as a non-return valve between the crank case and outside atmosphere, 
causing a partial vacuum in the crankcase and rocker boxes which prevents the passage of oil 
into the cylinder. If the breather is not acting efficiently it may cause pressure in the crankcase 
instead of partial vacuum, giving rise to smoking or oiling of the plug. 
17. Gear Box 
The gears, ratchet mechanism etc, of the gear box can also be serviced without dismantling 
the engine from the frame. 
Please refer page 33 for dismantling the gear box. 
28 
SERVICE OPERATIONS 
ENGINE REMOVED FROM FRAME 
1. Removal of the Engine from the Frame 
A. Disconnect alternator leads, B. Disconnect the spark plug cap. Suppressor cap C. Turn 
off petrol tap and disconnect the fuel pipe, D. Remove carburettor assy. along with throttle 
cable, E. Remove the air filter assy., F. Remove the exhaust pipe and Silencer, G. Disconnect 
the engine steady bolt, H. Remove the rear chain, I. Remove the footrest (L.H.), J. Support the 
engine on a suitable box or wood block, K. Remove the centre stand and the stand stop, 
L.Remove the front engine plates and the small bolt fixing the stand spring bracket and fixes 
rear mudguared, M. Remove the stud securing the rear engine plate to the frame, N. Slide out 
the engine. 
2. Removal of the Gearbox 
Remove the primary chaincase outer, clutch assembly, stator and rotor, engine sprocket and 
clutch sprocket. Remove the clutch centre and chain case inner. 
Remove four 3/8" nuts and the gearbox can then be withdrawn from the engine. 
3. Dismantling the Crankcase 
Drain the oil tank by removing the feed and return filter assembly plugs located in the crank-case 
bottom. 
Having removed the engine from the frame dismantle the cylinder head, barrel, piston, timing 
gear, etc., as described in the chapter "Decarbonising". 
Remove the nuts on the driving side of the engine from four fixed studs at the rear of the 
crankcase. 
Remove six studs passing through the crankcase by undoing nuts. 
The two halves of the crankcase can then be separated. 
The driving side outer race of bearings will remain in the driving side half of the crankcase. 
The driving side bearing inner race and the inner distance piece will remain on the engine 
shaft. (Crank shaft) 
The flywheel assembly may be removed from the driving side of the crankcase. 
4. Removal and Reassembly of main bearings 
1. Clean the crank case thoroughly as any trace of oil in the crankcase will burn and 
discolour the bearing race while healing the crank case. 
2. Heat the crankcase in an oven or apply the naked flame of a blow lamp on the 
circumferential area of the bearing boss and not directly on the bearing race. When the crankcase 
gets heated up fairly, tap the crankcase on a wooden block (with bearing race facing downwards) 
gently so that it will drop down due to the expansion of the bearing boss. 
3. Remove the circlip from the driving side crankcase and reheat to remove the ball bearing. 
29 
Inspect the bearings before assembly. The bearing should spin smoothly. Rotated dry, it 
may appear to be slightly noisy but there should be no signs of corrosion, nor must there be 
any appreciable radial slackness. The outer race of the roller bearing must be preferably smooth 
and bright with no evidence of cracks or pitting. The individual rollers must show no signs of 
wear and should rotate smoothly in the cage. It is recommended to replace with new bearings, 
once they are removed from the crankcase. 
Reheat the crank cases to reassemble the bearings in the crankcase. Assemble the ball 
bearing in the D/S. Crankcase after fitting the circlip. Locate the other circlip, distance tubes 
outer and inner and then assemble the roller bearing outer race. 
Ensure that the bearings are seated properly in the crank case and the outer roller race is 
flush with the crank case. 
TIMING SIDE ROLLER BEARING ASSEMBLY DRIVING SIDE BEARING ASSEMBLY 
5. Replacement of the Cam Idler Spindles 
When wear is noticed or step formation seen on the spindle, it should be replaced. To 
remove the cam spindle, heat the crankcase and tap the spindles out from inside. 
To remove the idler pinion spindles, heat the crankcases as before, hold the spindles in a 
vice and tap the crankcase lightly with a nylon/wooden hammer. 
To replace the cam spindles, locate the spindles in respective holes in the timing side 
crankcase and drive the spindles in home with a small hammer (1 / 2 Ib.) and a drift. Make 
sure that the spindles are upright and parallel to each other. 
6. Connecting Rod 
Wear in the hardened steel big end bush Will be shown by a formation of a 
ridge round the centre of the bearing surface corresponding with the oil groove in 
the white metal floating bush. If this wear is excessive the connecting rod should 
be replaced. 
Excessive wear on the small end of the connecting rod can be easily seen. The 
Gudgeon Pin will show a rocking motion if wear is excessive. 
CONNECTING ROD 
30 
FLYWHEEL ASSEMBLY 
FLYWHEEL IN A JIG 
7. Flywheel Assembly 
The flywheel assembly consists of the crankshaft and the connecting rod. 
To dismantle the crankshaft remove the set screws securing the crankpin nuts. Holding the 
crankshaft in a special jig. (PED 2037) Remove the crankpin nuts. 
Using PED 2037, with a pair of steel bars (about 1" x 3/8 x 9" long) placed across, between the 
fly wheel disc, press out the crankpin using a hand press. 
The connecting rod can then be removed along with floating bush. 
Turn the crankshaft over in the jig and repeat with other side if necessary. 
To remove the timing shaft, remove the set screw from the shaft nut and unscrew the nut. 
Drive the shaft out with a hammer and drift. To replace the timing side shaft, reverse the above 
process, making sure that the key is a good fit and that the nut 
is tightened securely by means of a box spanner with a 12" tommy 
bar. 
The driving shaft has no nut but is secured by tightening the 
sprocket nut after the assembly of the engine. It should be pressed 
in with a hand press or a hammer and drift. If the latter is used 
care must be taken not to damage the centre. It has a collar 
which butts against the flywheel disc. 
To reassemble the crankshaft, press the crankpin into the tim-ing 
side flywheel, making sure that the oil hole is in the correct 
position and the thrust washer is facing the right way. i.e. with Chamfer away from the fly-wheel. 
Test the oil passages using an oil can to make sure that they are clear. 
Assemble the floating bush over the crankpin. 
Assemble the connecting rod over the floating bush and smear engine oil. 
Place the other thrust washer over the crankpin, also with the Chamfer away from the fly-wheel. 
Use a brass drift and hammer for pressing the D/S flywheel. 
Locate the flywheel in the assembly jig, to ensure that the flywheels and shafts are in line and 
replace the nuts, tighten securely and refit the set screws. 
Test the oil passages again to ensure that they are clear. 
If the same crankpin has been put back, it will be neces-sary 
to drill out the old grub screw, in order to clean the 
oil passages after which a new grub screw must be fitted. 
Mount the crankshaft between the centres of a lathe or on 
a pair of vee block and true upto .001" on either side of 
the shafts. 
If the readings for the two shafts are high on opposite 
sides, the error can be corrected by gently tapping either 
or both of the flywheels. 
If the readings are high on the same side of the two shafts, 
it is probably due to dirt or foreign matter in the joints 
and the crankshaft should be dismantled again, carefully 
examined and cleaned and re-assembled. 
31 
8. Re-assembly of the Crankcase 
Replace the bearings, etc., in the crankcase halves after heating the crankcase as described 
earlier. (Refer page No 29) 
Fit the inner distance piece in the driving side crankcase. 
Fit the thrust washer on the drive shaft. Fit the bearing inner race on the drive shaft. 
Assemble the flywheel into the bearing. if necessary using the sprocket nut with a suitable 
spacer to draw the driving shaft through the inner race of the ball bearing. 
Make sure that the crankcase face is clean and apply jointing compound to it and fix the 
crankcase gasket in position. 
Put the thrust washer on the timing side shaft and press the bearing inner race. 
Place the timing side crankcase in position 
over the flywheel and gently tap with a wooden 
mallet. 
Bolt the two halves of the crankcase together, 
making sure that the joint matches correctly so 
that the cylinder base is flat. 
Rotate the drive shaft by hand and check for 
freeness to ensure correctness in assembly and 
press the oilseal on to the drive side of the 
crankcase from outside, ensuring proper seating. 
For 500cc 
Press the oil seal on the timing side of the 
crankcase and ensure proper seating. 
TWO HALVES OF CRANKCASE T/S & D/S 
32 
GEAR BOX WITH OUTER COVER REMOVED 
The gear box is bolted on to the back of the crankcase and has fourspeeds, 
which are foot-controlled, and a patented neutral finder. All gears are in constant 
mesh, changes being effected by robust dog clutches. 
The internal gear ratios are 2.77: 1 ( 1st Gear), 1.84: 1 (2nd Oar) 1.36: 1 (3rd 
gear) and 1 : 1 (Top gear) 
GEAR BOX 
NOTE: Before atempting to remove the internal parts. Please ensure that the clutch assy. has 
been dismantled alongwith F.D. sprocket 
1. Removal of Gear box from engine 
This has already been described earlier 
2. Dismantling the Gear box 
The gear box can be completely dismantled with the engine in the frame except for the removal 
of the inside operator and the bearings in the gear box case. Remove the kick starter crank, the 
gear change lever and the neutral finder. Remove the top and bottom small inspection covers 
and disconnect the clutch cable, after loosening clutch adjuster. Remove four screws and the 
gear box outer cover can then be detached. Remove the foot control plate assembly and foot 
control short by taking off the two nuts securing it. Remove the main shaft bearing cover 
which is attached by two screws. 
CAUTION: Hold the Kick starter return-ing 
spring eyelet by means of a long 
screwdriver to prevent it from rebound-ing 
(and causing damage) while the main 
shaft bearing cover screw is removed. 
The main shaft can be drawn straight 
out, if the clutch has been removed, 
which, however, should be done before 
taking off the gear box inner cover. The 
top gear pinion and dog will come away 
with the mainshaft. 
The layshaft can then be removed and 
the second and third gears drawn off the 
final drive sleeve together with the op-erator 
fork. 
NOTE: To take out the main shaft sleeve, 
the final drive sprocket must be removed 
and this is preferably done before remov 
ing the inner cover. 
3. Removal of the Ball Bearings 
The mainshaft ball bearings can be 
removed by using a stepped drift of 
0.437" (11 mm) & 1.171" (29.77,mm) in diameter for the bearing in the case and 0.812" 
(20.64 mm) & 0.515" (13.1 mm) in diameter for the bearing in the cover. 
When refitting the bearing stepped drifts of 2.31" (58.7mm) & 1.171" (29.7mm) diameter 
and 1" (25.4mm) in diameter, must be used for bearings in the case and cover respectively. 
4. Gear Change Mechanism 
If the two pins securing the gear change ratchet mechanism are slackened, the adjuster 
plate can be set in the desired position. In this position the movement of the gear lever, necessary 
to engage the ratchet teeth will be approximately the same in each direction. 
If the plate is incorrectly adjusted, it may be found that, after moving top to third or from 
bottom to second gear, the outer ratchets will not engage the teeth on the inner ratchets correctly. 
33 
CHANGE GEAR MECHANISM 
When fitting new 
_parts, if it is found that 
the gears do not engage 
properly, ascertain 
whether a little more 
movement is required 
or whether there is too 
much movement so 
that the gear slips right 
through second or third 
gear into neutral. If 
more movement is 
required, even after 
adjusting the adjuster 
plate then this can be 
obtained by filing the 
foot control stop plate 
very slightly at the 
points of contact with 
the pegs on the ratchet 
ring. 
If too much 
movement is already 
present, a new foot 
control stop plate giving 
less movement must be 
fitted. 
4.1Gear box with Continental controls. 
The procedure for dismantling the gear box with 
continental controls is the same as described earliar. 
While dismantling the gear change mechanism care 
should be taken to disconnect the foot control lever from 
the gear shift shaft after loosening the hex bolt. The circlip 
provided on the gear shift shaft should also be removed 
prior to removing the inner cover. 
Grease nipples are provided on the shift shaft and gear 
lever on the left side of the motorcycle for periodical 
greasing to ensure smooth operation of shift shaft and 
gear lever. 
If excessive gear lever travel is noticed and gear 
engagement becomes difficult, the plastic bushes provided 
at the gear linkages would have worn out and will have to 
be replaced with new bushes to reduce play in the linkages.

5. Re-assembling the Gear box 
The procedure is the reverse of that given above for dismantling but the following points should 
be noted. 
If the main shaft top gear pinion and dog have been removed, make sure that the dog is replaced 
the right way round or third and top gears can be engaged simultaneously. 
Make sure that the trunnions on the operator fork engage with the slots in the inside operator. 
See that the_main shaft is pushed right home. (It may be tight because of the felt washer inside 
the final drive shaft nut). 
The layshaft top gear and kickstarter pinion, should be assembled on the layshaft and the 
kickstarter shaft and Ratchet assembled on to it before fitting the end cover. Do not forget the 
washer on the layshaft between the kickstarter pinion and kickstarter shaft. 
The joint between the gear box and the inner cover should be made with shellac or any similar 
jointing compound. 
Make sure that all parts are clean before commencing assembly. The gear box should be packed 
with soft grease (veedol 'oo' grease or equivalent) filled up to the correct level. 
On no account must heavy yellow grease be used. 
6. Adjustment of the Neutral Finder 
The neutral finder is adjusted by means of an eccentric stopper secured to the front of the gear 
box cover by a bolt which limits the travel of the operating pedal. Slacken the bolt and turn the

7. Lubrication of the Gear box 
Current machines have the gear box filler plug at the top of the box and a level plug at the rear. Remove 
both plugs and fill, with the machine on leveiground until the oil commences to flow from the level plug. 
Check the level every 800 to 1,600 Km. when the gear box is warm. 
For initial filling up of gear box VEEDOL '00' grease is recommended. During routine maintenance, 
topping up may be done with SAE 50 oil. 
The capacity is 700 grams (Approx.) of '00' grease mixed with SAE 50 grade oil to a thick 
consistency.

LUBRICATION SYSTEM 
LUBRICATION SYSTEM 
Lubrication system is by Dry Sump and effected by an automatic and positive double action 
oil pumps. 
The oil tank is integral with the crankcase, for ensuring the full rate of oil circulation 
immediately when the engine is started and for rapid heating of the oil in cold weather. The 
capacity of the oil sump is 2.25 Ltrs. (SAE 50 grade). There are two piston type oil pumps 
running at 1/12 of engine speed positively driven by the worm gear on the timing shaft. 
The feed pump is at the rear of the timing cover (Left side when viewed from the front) and 
pumps oil from the oil tank, through the oil filter to the big end through the timing shaft. After 
lubrication of the big end bearings, the oil splashes and lubricates the cylinder barrel walls 
and drains to the bottom of the crank case. 
The return pump (front side of the timing cover) draws the oil from the crank case through 
the drilled passage and passes through the rocker oil pipe and lubricates the rocker bearings 
and valve spring mechanism and flows down though the push rod tunnels into the timing 
cover chest. 
From here, the drained oil is pumped back to the oil tank though a hole (drilled in the RH 
crankcase). by the two idler pinions. The return pump has a capacity of approximately double 
that of the feed pump, which ensures that oil does not accumulate in the crankcase. If allowed 
to accumulate it will lead to smoke - oil splash through breather pipe and starvation of oil to 
rocker arm bearings. 
Both pumps are double acting, 
but two sides of feed pump are 
inter-connected, thereby giving 
an augmented and even supply 
to the big-end. Return pump is 
also inter-connected for effective 
scavenging from crank case. 
Gauze strainers are provided 
for both feed and return filters 
from the crankcase to ensure oil 
is free from dirt and sludge. 
Oil Filter: The oil filter has a 
special and important feature in 
design. In the case of clogged filter 
or should it be neglected the oil 
pressure will lift the spring and 
cap off of its seat, thereby 
automatically by-passing the filter 
so that the big end bearings will 
not be deprived of lubrication, 
even though the oil may be dirty.

REAR SPRING BOX REMOVAL 
FRAME REAR SUSPENSION 
1. Description of Frame 
The frame is built of special cold drawn welded steel tubing incorporating reinforcements 
wherever necessary, for extra strength. 
The swinging arm unit forms the chainstay and is fitted with rubber bonded 'silent-bloc' 
bushes. The swinging arm unit is secured to the main frame by a long bolt passing through the 
pivot lugs. 
2. Removal of Rear Spring Box Unit/ Servicing Rear Spring Box 
Remove the top pivot pin nut, drive out the pivot 
pin, then hinge the suspension unit back on the lower 
pivot pin. After removing the lower nut, the unit may 
be pushed off the pivot pin welded to the fork end. It is 
a sealed unit and the internal mechanism cannot be 
serviced. Outer dust cover can be removed using spe-cial 
tool PED- 2039 for cleaning coil spring. 
3. Removal of Swinging Arm Chain Stay 
Remove the rear wheel, chain. rear sprocket and 
brake cover plate assembly from the swinging arm chain 
stay. Remove one of the pivot nuts and pull the pivot 
pin from the other end. The chainstay can then be pulled 
out of the frame. 
The life of the rubber bonded 'silent-bloc bushes is 
very high. But if it is necessary to replace the bushes, 
the inner sleeves will have to be pressed out first on a 
press. The rubber can then be taken away from the 
outer sleeves by pliers. The outer sleeves can be driven 
out by means of a hammer and a suitable drift. 
Replace the rubber bonded bushes in the swinging 
arm, using a suitable drift, press one bush from one 
end of the pivot bearing tube under a press, until the 
metal outer sleeve is flush with the end face of the pivot bearing tube. While pressing, it must 
be ensured that pressure is exerted only on the outer sleeve and not on the inner sleeve of the 
bush, as axial pressure on the inner sleeve would destroy the bonding of the rubber to the 
metal sleeves. Similarly press the second bush from the other side of the pivot bearing tube 
until the metal outer sleeve is flush with its end face. 
While assembling, the swinging arm fitted with rubber bonded 'silent-bloc' bushes, to the 
frame, the pivot nuts should be fully tightened only with the swinging arm positioned in the 
mid-stroke of the spring boxes, i.e., when the centre distance between the spring box top 
mounting hole in the frame and the bottom mounting pin on the swinging arm is 9.75". This 
is recommended so that, the rubber bush will be subjected to minimum angular movement in 
either direction from the mid stroke.

damped) 
1. Description 
The telescopic fork consists of two legs each 
of which comprises a main tube of alloy steel 
tubing which is screwed into the Casquette fork 
head at the upper end and securely clamped to 
the fork crown. Fitted over the lower end of the 
main tube is the bottom tube made of high 
strength aluminium alloy with an integral lug 
which carries the wheel spindle. Fitted on the 
lower end of the main tube is a steel bush which 
is a close fit in the bore of the bottom tube. The 
upper end of the bottom tube carries a cast iron 
bush which is a close fit over the outside 
diameter of the main tube. These bushes are not 
being fitted on to the latest Front Fork As-semblies. 
The bush is secured to the bottom 
tube by means of a threaded housing which 
contains two oil seals. A stud known as the 
'spring stud' is fitted in the lower end of the 
bottom tube and a valve port is secured to the 
lower end of the main tube. As the fork operates 
oil is forced between the spring stud and the bore 
of the valve port forming a hydraulic damping 
system. A compression spring is fitted inside the 
main tube between the upper end of the spring 
stud and the upper end of the main tube. The 
lower end of the main tube and upper end of the 
bottom tube are protected by a cover secured to 
the fork crown. 
2. Operation of the Fork 
The fork provides a range of movement of 6" 
from the fully extended to the fully compressed 
position. The movement is controlled by the 
compression spring and by the hydraulic damp-ing 
system. The hydraulic damping is light on the 
bump stroke and heavier on the rebound stroke, thus damping out any tendency to pitching or 
oscillation without interfering unduly with the free movement of the fork when the wheel encounters 
an obstacle or a pot hole. 
43 
MAIN TUBE SPANNER PED-2026 
The fork is filled with a light oil (S.A.E. 30) to a point above the lower end of the spring so 
that the damper chamber 'B' is always kept full of oil. Upward movement of the wheel spindle 
forces oil from the lower chamber 'A' through the annular space between the spring stud and 
the bore of the main tube valve port into the damper chamber 'B'. During this stroke the 
pressure on the underside of the valve plate causes this to lift so that oil can also pass from 'A' 
to 'B' through the eight holes in the valve body. Since, however, the diameter of chamber 'B' is 
less than that of chamber 'A' there is no room in 'B' to receive all the oil which must be 
displaced from 'A' as the fork operates. The surplus oil passes through the cross hole in the 
spring stud and up the centre hole in the stud, spilling out through the nut which secures the 
upper end of the spring stud to the guide at the lower end of the fork spring. 
On the rebound stroke, the oil in the damper chamber 'B' is forced through the annular 
space between the spring stud and the bore of the main tube valve port. During this stroke 
pressure in chamber 'B' closes the two disc valves at the upper and lower ends of the chamber 
so that the only path through which the oil can escape is the annular space between the spring 
stud and the port. Damping on the rebound stroke is therefore heavier than on the bump 
stroke. At the extreme end of either pump or rebound stroke a small taper portion on the 
spring stud enters the bore of the valve port, thus restricting the annular space and increasing 
the amount of damping. At the extreme end of the bump stroke the larger diameter taper on 
the oil control collar enters the main counterbore of the valve port thus forming a hydraulic 
cushion to prevent metal to metal contact. 
3. Dismantling the Fork 
Place the machine on the centre stand, disconnect the front 
brake control cable & speedometer connection and remove the 
front wheel and mudguard complete with stays. Unscrew the 
bottom spring, stud nut which will allow oil to run out of the 
fork down to the level of the cross hole in the spring stud. Now 
knock the spring stud upwards into the fork with a soft mallet, 
thus allowing the remainder of the oil to escape. Pull the fork 
bottom tube down as far as possible, thus exposing the oil seal 
housing. In the latest version the oil seal housing is eliminated 
and the oilseals are provided as an integral part of bottom tubes. 
Hence by pulling the bottom tube downwards the same can be 
removed from the forkmain tubes. [For old type front forks: 
Unscrew this housing by means of a spanner on the flats with 
which it is provided. The bottom tube can now be withdrawn completely from the main tube 
leaving the bottom tube bush, oil seal housing and oil seal in position on the main tube.] 
Now unscrew the main tube valve port using special tool PED 2026. The spring stud and 
spring can now be withdrawn from the lower end of the main tube. 
NOTE: In the latest version the oilseal housing and steel bush has been eliminated on 
introduction of integral oil seals in the bottom tubes. 
The steel main tube bush can now be tapped off the lower end of the tube, if necessary 
using the bottom tube bush for this purpose. Before doing this, however, it is advisable to 
mark the position of the bush with a pencil so as to ensure re-assembling it in the same 
position on the main tube. The reason for this is that these bushes are ground to size, after 
fitting on to the tubes, so as to ensure concentrictly. After removal of the main tube bush, 
44 
bottom tube bush and oil seal housing, the main tube can be removed using tool PED 2036ST. 
Before attempting to loosen the main tubes ensure that the 2 pinch bolts on the fork crown 
bottom has been sufficiently loosened to allow the main tubes to rotate. 
4. Spring 
The free length of the spring is 20 1/2". The spring should be replaced if it has closed by 
more than 1 inch. 
5. Re-assembly 
When refitting the oil seal, or fitting a new one, great care must be exercised not to damage 
the synthetic rubber lip which forms the actual seal. 
NOTE: (Only for Old Type Forks) If the oil seal housing has been removed from the upper 
end of the main tube and is refitted from this end, a special nose piece must be fitted over the 
threaded end of the tube to prevent damage to the oil seal. 
The spring stud is a tight fit in the hole at the lower end of the bottom tube. Once the stud 
has been located in the hole, push the bottom tube up sharply against the spring until two or 
three threads on the stud project beneath the end of the bottom tube. Now fit the nut and 
washer and pull the stud into position by tightening the nut. If necessary fit the nut first 
without the washer until sufficient thread is projecting to enable the washer to be fitted. 
6. Removal of Complete fork Assembly 
The fork complete with front wheel and mudguard can be removed from the machine, if 
necessary, by adopting the following procedure. The leads to the lighting switch and ammeter 
should be disconnected at their lower ends or by means of the plug and socket connectors 
when these are provided. 
Disconnect the speedometer drive from the speedometer head. 
Remove the two plug screws and loosen the steering head clip bolt and the two fork crown 
clamp bolts. 
Unscrew the fork main tubes from the head lamp casing and the steering stem locknut 
from the top of the steering stem, turning each tube and the nut a turn or two at a time. When 
the nut has been removed from the steering stem and the main tubes have been completely 
unscrewed from the head lamp casing, the complete fork and wheel with steering stem can be 
removed 
7. Lubrication 
The lubrication of the fork internal parts is effected by the oil which forms the hydraulic 
damping medium. All that is necessary is to keep sufficient oil in the fork to ensure that the 
top end of the bottom spring stud is never uncovered even in the full rebound position. The 
level of oil in the fork can be gauged by removing the top plug screw and inserting a long rod 
about 3/8" diameter. If slightly tilted this will wedge against the nut at the upper end of the 
bottom spring stud.If the oil is above the spring stud, it will leave a trace on the long rod, 
which can be seen on removal. This trace of oil implies that oil level is correct. If the fork is 
empty to start with, the quantity required is approximately 200m1 in each leg. Recommended 
grade of oil is hydraulic oil or SAE 10 W 30.

8. Steering Head Races 
The steering head races are the same at the top and bottom of the head lug. They are easily 
removed by knocking them out with a hammer and drift and new races can be fitted either by a 
press or by means of a hammer and wooden drift. The steering head bearing consists of two deep 
groove thrust races each containing nineteen 1/4" diameter balls. The bearing is adjusted by 
tightening the steering stem locknut after loosening the ball head clip screw and both the fork crown 
clamp bolts. The head should be adjusted-so that, when the front wheel is lifted clear of the ground, 
a light tap on the handlebar will cause the steering to swing to full lock in either direction, while at 
the same time there should be only the slight trace of play in the bearings. 
The play can be felt by keeping a finger across the head races just below the ball head on the 
top ball race. Do not forget to tighten the ball head clip screw and fork crown clamp bolts. Before 
tightening the latter make sure that the cover tubes are located centrally round the main tubes so 
that the bottom tube does not rub inside the cover tube. A pair of split bushes, as shown in figure 
is useful to ensure centralisation of the cover tubes. 
ADJUSTMENT OF HEAD BALL-RACE 
SEQUENCE FOR ADJUSTMENT 
1. Loosen the Head lamp casing clip bolt by using 
an Allen key (Size - 5mm) 
2. Loosen the front fork crown clip bolts (2 Nos.) 
3. Then screw down the steering stem lock nut by 
-thread to ---thread to - Lf thread initially and check the play 
once again. If necessary further tightening can 
be done. 
Note: Over tightening of this Steering stem lock 
nut will result in vehicle drag. 
9. Lubrication-Steering Head 
The steering head races and stand pivot bearing 
should be well greased on assembly. No nipples are 
provided for the steering head as experience has 
shown that the provision of nipples at this point 
causes trouble through chafing and cutting of control 
and lighting cables. If the steering head bearings are 
well packed with grease initially they will last for 
several years or many thousands of kilometres.

WHEELS 
FRONT WHEEL 
1. Removal from Fork 
To remove the front wheel from the fork place the machine on the centre stand with sufficient 
packing beneath the stand to lift the front wheel clear off the ground when vehicle is tilted back. 
Slacken the brake cable adjustment and disconnect the cable from the handlebar lever and 
from the operation cam lever on the hub. 
Disconnect speedometer driving cable. Unscrew the four nuts securing the fork Lug caps 
and allow the wheel to drop forward out of the front fork. Make sure that the machine stands 
securely on the rear wheel and centre stand - if necessary place a weight on the dual seat or 'a 
strut beneath the front end of engine near Frame down tube to ensure this. 
2. Dismantling 
Lock the brake 'on', by applying the front brake, and unscrew the cover plate nut. (For 
Front brake with twin leading shoes loosen the lock nuts on the link rod and turn link rod so 
that both brake shoes become free and are not in contact with the brake drum) The cover plate 
assembly can then be withdrawn from the brake drum. 
The brake shoes can be removed after detaching the return springs. Brake linings are 
supplied in pairs and are of 'Bonded' type hence linings cannot be separated and refixed with 
new linings. 
To remove the operating cam unscrew the nut, which secures the operating lever to the 
splines on the cam. A sharp tap on the end of the cam spindle will now free the lever, after 
which the cam can be withdrawn from its housing. The brake shoe pivot pin can be removed 
after unscrewing the nut which secures it to the cover plate. 
To remove the hub spindle and bearings, having first removed the brake cover plate, unscrew 
the retaining nut by holding the spindle on a benchvice with soft jaws. Remove speedo drive 
assembly and the felt washer from the otherside of the hub. Remove the felt washer and the 
distance washer from the brake drum side and hit one end of the spindle with a brass or 
plastic mallet, thus driving it out of the hub, bringing one bearing with it and leaving the other 
in position in the hub. Drive the bearing off the spindle and insert the latter once more in the 
hub through the end from which it was removed. Now drive the spindle through the hub, the 
other way, which will bring out the other bearing. 
3. Fitting Limits for Bearings 
The fit of the bearings in the hub barrel is important. The bearings are locked on the spindle 
between shoulders and the distance pieces, which in turn are held by the nuts on the spindle. 
In order to prevent endways pre-loading of the bearings, it is essential that there is a small 
clearance between the inner edge of the outer race of the bearing and the back of the races in 
either end of the barrel. To prevent any possibility of sideways movement of the hub barrel on 
the bearing,it is therefore necessary for the bearings to be a tight fit in the barrel, but this fit 
must not be so tight as to close down the outer race of the bearing and thus overload the ball 
race in the bearing

To refit the bearings in the hub, two hollow drifts (Special Tool No. PED 2011) are required. 
One bearing is first fitted to one end of the spindle by means of the hollow drift. The spindle 
and bearing are then inserted into one end of the hub barrel, which is then supported on one 
of the hollow drifts. The other bearing is then inserted over the upper end of the spindle and 
driven home by means of the second hollow drift either under a press or by means of a hammer, 
which will thus drive both bearings into position simultaneously. 
In order to make quite sure that there is clearance between the inner faces of the outer 
bearing races and the bottom of the recesses in the hub, fit the distance washers, cover plate, 
dust excluder and the nuts on the spindle. Tightening the nuts should not have any effect on 
the ease with which the spindle can be rotated.

If tightening the nuts makes the spindle hard to turn, the bearings are bottoming in the 
recesses in the hub barrel and the inner races are not resting on the shoulder of the spindle. 
In this case, the bearing should be removed and a thin packing shim should be fitted between 
the inner race and the shoulder on the spindle. 
Assemble the operating cam into cover plate after smearing grease, on the pivot pin and 
the cylindrical bearing surface of the operating cam. Fit the operating lever, on its splines in a 
position to suit the extent of wear on the linings and secure with the nut and washer. Note that 
the position of the operating lever may have to be corrected when adjusting the brake after 
refitting the wheel. The range of adjustment can be extended by moving this lever on to a 
different spline. 
NOTE: Before replacing the felt washers which form the grease seals, pack all bearings with 
medium/lime soap or aluminium soap greases or multipurpose grease. The use of H.M.P. 
greases which have a soda soap base is not recommended, as these tend to be slightly corrosive 
if any dampness finds its way into the hubs. 
Make sure that the inside of the brake drum is quite free from oil or grease, dampness, etc. 
When replacing the speedo drive, make sure that the dogs on the speedo drive are correctly 
engaged with the slots in the end of the hub barrel. Make sure that the speedo drive is correctly 
positioned, so that the speedo cable would not be too stretched or will not have any sharp 
bends. Replace the felt washers, distance collars, and brake cover plate and securely tighten 
the spindle nuts.

REAR WHEEL 
1. Removal of wheel - quickly-detachable type 
The rear wheel is quickly detachable without disturbing the sprocket. Place vehicle on 
centre stand. Remove the split pin and the castle nut securing the long spindle which is 
located on the sprocket side. Slide out the long spindle from the wheel and remove both the 
spacers from the RH side fork end. Tilt the vehicle and slide out the wheel from the chainstay. 
For assembly reverse the process but take care to engage the cush rubbers properly on the 
driving lugs. 
2. Cush Drive 
Four rubber blocks are fitted in the pockets of centre hub and four radial vanes are formed 
REASSEMBLY OF CUSH DRIVE on the back of the rear sprocket/brake drum, thus 
transmitting both driving and braking torque and 
smoothening out harshness and irregularity in the 
former. 
If the cush drive rubbers are worn, and the amount 
of free movement measured at the tyre exceeds 1 / 2" 
to 1", the rubbers should be replaced. The condition 
of the cush drive rubber in the rear wheel can be 
gauged by placing the machine on the rear stand, 
applying the rear brake and rotating the rear wheel. 
The cush rubbers are fixed in the pockets of centre 
hub by means of buttons provided in the rubber 
blocks, thus the rubbers are prevented from falling 
down when wheel is removed or refitted. 
3. Removal and re-assembly of rear wheel sprocket 
Removal of sprocket is necessary only if replacement of sprocket or attention to brakes is 
required. Remove the wheel as described above. Remove the brake rod nut and disconnect the 
brake rod from the operating lever. Be sure to 'DISCONNECT' the stop light switch from the 
link, otherwise the switch will get damaged. Remove the securing bolts of the chainguard at 
both front and rear ends and remove the chain guard. Disconnect the chain link. Remove the 
securing nuts from brake anchor and wheel spindle. Unwrap the chain from the rear sprocket. 
Slide out the rear sprocket assembly from the chainstay. 
For re-assembly proceed in the reverse order . Make sure that the inside of the brake drum 
is quite free from oil grease dampness etc. Ensure the chain lock clip is fitted in the right 
direction so that the closed end of the clip is towards the direction of motion. The rear chain 
should be inspected for wear before assembly. It should be renewed when its length has increased 
by 1-1 /8" than a new chain. The rear Chain can be adjusted by slackening the wheel spindle 
nuts and brake anchor shoe pin nut and turning the notched cam plate.

4. Dismantling the Rear Brake Shoes. 
After separating the cover plate from sprocket assy, unscrew the brake shoe pivot pin lock 
nut and the operating lever nut. The assembly of brake shoes, return springs, pivot pin and 
operating cam can be removed from the cover plate by unscrewing the pivot pin and applying 
light blows with a hammer and drift on the end of the operating cam. The return spring can 
then be unhooked from the brake shoes. 
Brake linings are supplied in pairs and are of bonded type hence linings cannot be seperated 
and refixed with new linings. 
5. Removal of bearing from centre hub and re-assembly 
The bearing from the centre hub can be removed by inserting a small rod of 6 mm dia. 
Insert the rod through the bearing at one end and through the slit provided, at the ends of the 
bearing distance tube. Hit the rod with a small mallet on radially opposite sides of the bearing. 
The other bearing also can be removed by hitting it from opposite side after the removal of 
grease seal. 
To remove the hub spindle (short) and bearings from the brake drum, having already removed 
the brake cover plate assy., hit outer end of the spindle with a brass hammer or mallet thus 
driving it out of the bearing. Now the grease seal and the bearing from the brake drum can be 
removed one after the other. 
The fit of the bearings in the hub barrel is important as in the case of Front wheel. 
To fit the bearings in the hub, use the two hollow drifts proceed as follows. In order to make 
sure that there is clearance between the inner faces of the bearings and the bottom of the 
recess, first fit the sealed bearing at the cush drive side of the centre hub so that the bearing 
will sit in the housing flush with the boss face. Then place the distance tube from other end 
and press the second bearing and also the grease seal. (small) 
NOTE: Before replacing the bearings in the centre hub as well as sprocket brake drum, 
pack with medium/heavy lime soap or aluminium soap grease. The use of HMP grease which 
have soda soap base is not recommended as these tend to be slightly corrosive if any dampness 
finds its way into the hub. 
6. Re-assembly of brake shoes 
Make sure that the brake shoe pivot pin is really tight in the cover plate and smear grease 
in the grooves of the pivot pin and on the operating face of the cam. Also smear grease on the 
OPERATION OF A SINGLE LEAD SHOE - DRUM BRAKE OPERATION OF A TWIN LEAD SHOE - DRUM BRAKE 
52 
cylindrical bearing surface of the operating cam, if this has been removed. Fit the operating 
lever on its splines in a position to suit the extent of wear on the linings and secure with the 
nut. The range of adjustment can be extended by moving the lever on to a different spline. 
Note that the bolt holes in the cover plate for locating the rear brake cam bush are slotted, 
to enable the brake shoe assy, to be centered in the drum. The brake cover plate assy with the 
shoes should be fitted over the spindle into the brake drum and the brake applied as hard as 
possible by means of the operating lever. This will centre the shoes in the drum. The brake 
cover plate assembly should then be removed and the screws should then be tightened fully 
and secured with the lock nuts. If the shoes are not correctly centred, the brake will be either 
ineffective or too fierce, depending on whether the trailing or leading shoe first makes contact 
with the drum. With the brake assy, correctly centered and screws securing the cam housing 
correctly tightened wear on both linings should be approx equal. 
7. Adjustment of Drive Chain 
DRIVE CHAIN ADJUSTMENT 
Check slackness of the drive chain every 1000 Kms. 
and adjust if necessary. The frequency of adjustment 
depends entirely on the rider habits and usage conditions. 
If the chain is adjusted too loose or too tight, the chain 
may either jump off the sprocket or might break, causing 
serious damage to vehicle/engine parts and may also lead 
to a serious accident. 
The Procedure for Adjusting the rear chain is as 
follows; 
Place the vehicle on its centre stand on a firm flat 
surface.Unfold and remove the split pin (1) on the castle 
nut on LH side of rear wheel. Loosen the castle nut (2). Loosen the stub axle nut (3) and rear 
brake anchor pin nut (4). Move the cam adjusters to the same number of notches on either 
side of the axle. Rotate the rear wheel and check the chain tension on the top run of the chain. 
The minimum free play of the chain should be 25 to 30 mm with the vehicle on its centre 
stand. Check the wheel alignment of front and rear wheel, using a straight edge or by means of 
stretching a rope from the front wheel to rear wheel. Retighten the stub axle nut. Rotate the 
rear wheel, apply the rear brake hard and hold the rear brake pedal firmly in the depressed 
position so that the brake assembly is centralised in the brake drum. Retighten the brake 
anchor pin nut. Release the brake pedal. Ensure that the chain adjuster on the RH side is 
butting against the peg on the chain stay and is not disturbed from its adjusted position. 
Retighten the castle nut fully such that the split pin hole is aligned. Locate the split pin in 
position and bend out the split ends. Check the chain tension again at 3 or 4 places by rotating 
the wheel and ensure the free play is 25 to 30 mm on the top run. 
8. Wheel Alignment 
NOTE: It is not possible to guarantee that the wheels are correctly aligned when the same 
notch position is used on both adjuster cams. It is therefore not sufficient to count the notches 
and use the same position on both sides of the machine. The only way to guarantee that the 
wheels are in line is to check the alignment from front wheel to back using either a straight 
edge or a piece of taut string. The alignment should be checked on both sides of the machine. 
53 
54 
Direction of rotation 
-_ de••••"" 
It is usual to check the alignment of the wheels at a point about six inches above the 
ground. If the alignment is checked also towards the top of the wheels, it will be possible to 
ascertain whether or not the frame is twisted so as to cause one wheel to be leaning while the 
other is vertical. To do that it is always necessary to remove the mudguards and unless a 
straight edge cut away in its centre portion is available, it will be necessary also to remove the 
cylinder, tool boxes, battery etc., in order to allow straight edge or a piece of taut string to 
contact the front and rear tyres. 
In the later models a punch mark is provided on both the chain adjusters. These punch 
marks can be used as reference marks and the chain adjusters must be moved by the same 
number of notches from this punch mark to ensure proper wheel alignment. 
9. General 
1. Wheel Rims 
The rim fitted to the wheel is WM 2.19" pierced with 40 holes for Locating the spoke nipples. 
2. Spokes 
The spokes are of plain type 4 mm dia with 90 degree counter sunk heads, angle of bend 80 
to 95 degree. Thread diameter is 4.4 mm x 0.7 pitch thread. Spoke lengths are 170 mm for the 
rear wheel and 165 mm for the front wheel. 
3. Wheel Building and Truing 
The spokes are laced in such a way that wheel must be built centrally in relation to the 
outer faces of the distance collars which fit between the fork ends. The rim should be trued as 
accurately as possible, the maximum permissible run-out both sideways and radially being 
plus or minus 1/32". 
SPOKE LOADINGS IN A WIRE WHEEL 
The key to correct lacing is the inside and outside spokes from the flange must slope down 
in the opposite direction as in the figure. The spokes are in opposite direction to the inner two 
spokes. In the group of four spokes laced, the inner spokes of each flange are sloping down in 
the opposite direction of the outer two spokes of the next grouping of four spokes and so on. 
4. Lubrication 
Front and rear wheel bearings are lubricated by packing them with grease every 10,000 
Kms. after dismantling the hub and requires no further attention. 
5. Tyres 
Standard tyres are of size 3.25.19" for Front & 3.50.19" for Rear. 
When removing the tyre always start close to the valve and see that the edge of the cover at 
the other side of the wheel pushed down into the well. 
If the correct method of fitting and removal of the tyre is adopted it will be found that the 
covers can be manipulated quite easily with the small tyre levers. The use of long levers and or 
excessive force is liable to damage the walls of the tyre. After inflation make sure that the tyre 
is fitting evenly all the way round the rim. A line moulded on the wall of the tyre indicates 
whether or not the tyre is correctly fitted. 
Please refer the attached diagrams in Page No.59 for correct procedure for removal and 
refitting of tyres.

ADJUSTMENT OF BRAKES 
1. Front Brake Twinleading Arrangement - Bullet 350/500 CC 
All Bullet 350 & 500 cc models are fitted with twinleading front brakes for effective braking. 
These are with bonded type brake shoes of 7" diameter. 
Where brake judder or sponginess is experienced and the cause is narrowed down to uneven 
braking of the front wheel, the procedure to adjust the same is as follows:

3. F/B Operating 
Lever (Long) 
4. L/Rod Turning 
Nut (RH) 
5. L/Rod Trunion 
Nut (LH) 
6. Procedure For Adjustment of Brakes 
2.1 Front wheel removed from the vehicle 
Hold the front wheel spindle in a benchvice with soft jaws to avoid damage to spindle. 
Remove the brake cover plate by loosening the nut and clean the brake drum and brake shoe 
assembly. 
Mark four or five lines with a chalk across the shoe lining surfaces and assemble the cover 
plate to the wheel and clamp it firmly with the nut. Hold the brake cam levers so that the brake 
shoes are binding lightly on to the drum and rotate the wheel in the normal direction of 
rotation (anti-clock wise direction looking from brake drum end). Remove the Brake cover 
plate and observe the marks on the brake shoe surfaces. If the contacts are uniform, the 
marks on the shoes would have been erased uniformly. If the mark on one side is not erased, 
it indicates that the brake shoe has to be moved towards the drum through adjustment provided. 
For example: if the shoe bearing on the cam connected to the short lever has the chalk marks 
intact then the shoe should be moved outwards towards the drum. For this adjustment, refit 
the cover plate assembly, hold the longer brake lever pulled fully in the operating direction so 
that the brake shoe is binding on the drum and proceed as follows: 
NOTE: Check the locknuts for threading - RH or LH. 
Loosen the locknuts provided at both the ends of link rod and rotate the link rod clockwise 
so as to move the short lever more towards the normal direction of the operation i.e. towards 
the longer lever. 
56 
Stop adjusting when the shoe has moved and touches the brake drum which can be felt 
while making the adjustment through the link rod. Then lock the two lock nuts provided at the 
end of link rod. If the marks on the shoe operated by the longer lever are not erased, carry out 
above adjustments in the reverse manner (anticlockwise) ensuring that both the brake shoes 
are in contact with the drum uniformly. 
CAUTION: Do not attempt to rotate the link rod without loosening the locknuts and do not 
overtighten the lock nuts on the link rod. The link rod threads might snap if either of the above 
is done. 
2.2. Without Removing Front Wheel From Vehicle 
Increase cable play by threading in the adjuster either at handle bar end or at fork bottom 
tube end. 
Loosen the link rod lock nuts sufficiently at the top and bottom (L & R threads). 
Apply front brake and hold the lever (Do not release the brake till the adjustment is complete). 
This would ensure that the brake shoe nearest to the drum would be in contact with the brake 
drum. 
Turn the link rod right to left (clockwise) or in the opposite direction simultaneously checking 
whether the short lever moves towards the long lever or vise versa. 
Turning the link rod would be easy till the other shoe also comes in contact with the brake 
drum and thereafter resistance would be felt and would be difficult to rotate further. 
Release the hand lever and check for free rotation of the front wheel (No brake binding 
should be felt and wheel should rotate free). 
Hold link rod in position and tighten lock nuts just sufficiently.Adjust the brake cable 
adjusters such that brake lever travel is 20 to 30 mm from its resting position. 
NOTE:l. The Link rod is provided with the LH and RH thread for the above adjustments. 
Hence the correct trunions and Lock nuts are to be used at the respective threaded ends. 
(Refer Diagram) 
2. Link rod adjustment can be made to compensate for the lining wear in the normal 
service life which avoids repositioning of the levers. 
3. Any excessive play in the Brake cable can be corrected by using the adjuster provided 
in the Front Brake Lever end at the handle bar and through the adjuster provided on the left 
hand fork bottom tube assembly. 
CAUTION: 1. If you are in doubt, please contact the authorised Dealer/Distributor for their 
guidance and for correct adjustment of the front brakes. 
2. Any mal-adjustment of the brake system will render the brakes inneffective and will 
affect the safety of the rider. 
2.3. Rear Brake 
Set brake pedal resting position with respect to the foot rest by adjusting the stop bolt 
provided on the left side on the main frame. 
Turn the adjusting nut on the brake rod, clock wise to reduce pedal travel and vise versa to 
increase pedal travel. 
The recommended travel is 20 to 30 mm. Rotate rear wheel and check for free rotation and 
ensure no brake; binding occurs. 
57 
TYRES - REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT 
1. At some time or other the need will arise to remove and replace the tyres, either as a result 
of a puncture or because renewal is required to offset wear. To the inexperienced, tyre chang-ing 
represents a formidable task, yet if a few simple rules are observed and the technique 
learned the whole operation is surprisingly simple. 
2. To remove the tyre from either wheel, first detach the wheel from the machine. Deflate the 
tyre by removing the valve insert and when it is fully deflated push the beading of the tyre away 
from the wheel rim on both sides so that the beading enters the centre well of the rim. Remove 
the locking cap and push the tyre valve into the tyre. 
3. Insert two tyre levers close to the valve, on either side of the valves and lever the edge of the 
tyre over the outside of the wheel rim. Very little force should be necessary; if resistance is 
encountered it is probably due to the fact that the tyre beading have not come off the wheel rim 
all around the tyre. 
4. Once the tyre has been edged over the wheel rim, it is easy to work around the wheel rim so 
that the tyre is completely free on one side. At this stage, the inner tube can be removed. 
5. Working from the other side of the wheel, ease the other edge of the tyre over the wheel rim. 
Continue to work around the rim until tyre is free completely from the rim. 
6. If a puncture has necessitated the removal of the tyre, reinflate the inner tube and immerse 
it in water to trace the source of the leak. Mark its position and deflate the tube. Dry the tube 
and clean the area around the puncture with a petrol soaked rag. When the surface has dried, 
apply rubber solution and allow this to dry before removing the protective sticker from a patch 
and applying the patch to the surface. 
7. It is best to use a patch of the self-vulcanising type, which will form a very permanent 
repair. Note that it may be necessary to remove another protective covering from the top sur-face 
of the patch, after it has sealed in position. Inner tubes made from synthetic rubber may 
require a special type of patch and adhesive if a satisfactory bond is to be achieved. 
8. Before replacing the tyre, check the inside of it to remove the foreign particle which caused 
the puncture. Check the outside of the tyre, particularly the tread area, to make sure nothing 
is trapped that may cause a further puncture. 
9. If the inner tube has been patched on a number of past occasions, or if there is tear or large 
hole, it is preferable to discard it and fit a new tube. 
10. To replace the tyre, inflate the inner tube just sufficiently for it to assume a circular shape. 
Then push it into the tyre so that it is enclosed completely. Lay the tyre on the wheel at an 
angle and insert the valve through the rim tape and the hole in the wheel rim. Attach the 
locking cap on the first few threads, sufficient to hold the valve captive in its correct location. 
11. Starting at the point furtherest away from the valve, push the tyre beading over the edge of 
the wheel rim until it is located in the central well. Continue to work around the tyre in the 
fashion until the whole of one side of the tyre is on the rim. It may be necessary to use a tyre 
lever during the final stages. 
58 
Use two levers to work bead over the edge of rim. 
Tyre fitting: Inflate inner tube and Insert in tyrc. 
Tyre removal: Deflate inner tube and insert lever in 
close proximity to tyre valve. 
When first bead is deaf, remove tyre as shown. 
i..iy tyre on rim and teed through hole in ri,n. Work first bead over rim. Using lever in final seciic,... 
Use similar technique for second head, finish at tyre Push valve and tube up into tyre when fitting final 
valve position. section, to avoid trapping. 
59 
12. Make sure that there is no pull on the tyre valve and again commencing with the area 
furtherest from the valve, ease the other beading of the tyre over the edge of the rim. Finish 
with the area close to the valve, pushing the valve up into the tyre until the locking cap 
touches the rim. This will ensure the inner tube is not trapped, when the last section of the 
beading is edged over the rim with a tyre lever. 
13. Check that the inner tube is not trapped at any point. Reinflate the inner tube, and 
check that the tyre is seated correctly around the wall of the tyre on both sides, which should 
be equidistant from the wheel rim at all points. If the tyre is unevenly located on the rim, try 
bouncing the wheel when the tyre is at the recommended pressure. It is probable that one of 
the beading has not pulled clear of the centre well. 
14. Always run the tyres at the recommended pressures and never under or over-inflate. 
See specifications for recommended pressures. 
15. Tyre replacement is aided by dusting the side walls, particularly in the vicinity of the 
beading with a liberal coating of French chalk. 
16. Never replace the inner tube and tyre without the rim tape in position. If this precaution 
is overlooked there is a good chance of the ends of the spoke nipples chafing the inner tube 
and causing a series of punctures. 
17. Never fit a tyre which has a damaged tread or side walls. Apart from the legal aspects 
there is a very great risk of a blow-out, which can have serious consequences on any two wheel 
vehicle. 
18. Tyre valves rarely give trouble but it is always advisable to check whether the valve 
itself is leaking before removing the tyre. Do not forget to fit the dust cap which forms an 
effective second seal. This is especially important on a high performance machine, where 
centrifugal force can cause the valve insert to retract and the tyre to deflate without warning. 
CAUTION: Sudden deflation may cause an accident, particularly if it occurs in the front 
wheel.

RECTIFIER CUM REGULATOR 
IGNITION AND LIGHTING SYSTEM 
1. General 
The A.C., Lighting and Ignition system comprises of seven main components: 
(i) Alternator (stator & rotor). (ii) Regulator and Rectifier (RR Unit) (iii) Ignition coil, (iv) 
Contact breaker unit with automatic timing control, (v) Lighting switch, (vi) Ignition switch, 
(vii) 12V. Battery. 
When the engine is started, the alternator generates AC energy which passes through the 
rectified as DC energy. This rectified DC gets regulated by the regulator and charges the battery 
depending on battery and load conditions. 
2. Alternator 
The alternator comprises of two main components, a stator and a rotor. The stator carries 
three pairs of series-connected coils. The rotor is a permanent magnet. The stator and rotor 
can be separated without the need to fit magnetic keepers to the rotor poles. 
As the rotor turns, paid and repeated reversals of flux take place in the coil cores. These 
lines cut through the turns of the coil and induce alternating voltages in that coil. External 
connections are taken from these coils to a regulator rectifier. 
3. Regulator-Rectifier unit 
The alternator which consists of stator and rotor has three pairs of series connected coils. 
The alternator output is directly 
connected to regulator rectifier 
AC input terminals. 
The control circuit of regulator 
rectifier unit monitors the battery 
voltage and regulates the 
charging current to the battery 
according to pre-set regulating 
range (Range: old:13.8 volts to 
14.6 volts. New: maximum of 
15.5 volts) 
During the day running 
period ie: ignition load alone, the 
battery voltage rises rapidly and 
the regulator starts regulating 
the charging current to the 
battery. 
When the head light is 
switched 'ON' more current is 
drawn from the battery and the regulator in turn allows higher current to flow into the battery 
for charging. 
61 
NEW REGULATOR AND RECTIFIER 
CIRCUIT DETAILS 
4. New type Regulator - Rectifier. (on Vehicles produced after July 1995) 
This is an improved version of the previous regulator cum rectifier. 
It is mounted under the seat dual. 
The input and output connections are the same 
as in the old unit. 
Salient feature: 
The modified regulator, rectifier has the advantage 
that in the event of the regulator failing and the 
ammeter not indicating charge, the regulator can be 
disconnected from the circuit and charging will take 
place without any regulation of current. 
Also the regulator or the rectifier can be replaced 
individually in the event of a failure. 
CAUTION: In case the regulator is faulty and has been disconnected from the circuit, it 
should be replaced through the nearest authorised Enfield dealer to prevent over charging of 
the battery and subsequent damage to the battery and other electrical systems.

6. Routine Maintenance 
The alternator and regulator rectifier requires no maintenance apart from ensuring that all 
connections are clean and tight. 
If the rotor, stator, engine crankshaft or rear half of the chaincase have been disturbed, the 
airgap between the rotor and stator should be checked for a minimum of 0.006" gap. 
The ignition coil is located beneath the.seat. It should be kept clean and the terminals kept 
tight. When the high tension cable shows signs of perishing or cracking it must be renewed. 
7. Contact Breaker Unit/Contact Set 
The contact breaker setting should be checked after the first 800 Kms. running and 
subsequently every 5,000 Kms. (3000 miles) 
Cleaning contact breaker points 
Remove the contact breaker cover and examine the contacts. If they are dirty or pitted, they 
must be cleaned by polishing with a fine carborandum stone or very fine emery cloth. Afterwards 
wipe away any dirt or metal dust with a petrol moistened cloth. 
CONTACT BREAKER OPERATION 
Setting contact breaker gap. 
To check or reset the gap, turn the engine over slowly until the piston is at TDC on 
compression stroke and the contacts are seen to be fully open. Insert 0.35 to 0.40 mm (0.014" 
- 0.16") feeler gauge between the contacts. Slacken the screw 'A' securing the fixed contact 
plate and adjust the position of the plate until the gap is the thickness of the feeler gauge and 
tighten. If the gap is correct, the gauge will be a sliding fit. 
Setting ignition timing. 
To check or reset the ignition timing, rotate, the crankshaft in the normal direction until 
the piston is just before TDC and the contact breaker points just commence to open. (The best 
way to check the opening of points is to switch on the ignition and crank the engine slowly 
until the ammeter needle just returns to its central position. The points should just commence 
to open at this position. Check the position of the piston which should now be 0.8mm before 
TDC on the compression stroke. At this position slacken the two screws B. Swing the base 
plate to the left to advance or to the right to retard the ignition. Retighten the two screws such 
64 
that the CB points gap just commenses to open. 
To check whether the adjustment is correct, 
insert a thin strip of tissue paper between the 
points and gently pull out the paper which 
should not get damaged and should be sliding 
fit. 
The most accurate method of setting timing 
is by using a dial gauge. Remove spark plug 
and fix a dial gauge on the spark plug hole 
using a suitable adaptor. Crank engine gently 
so that piston is at TDC on compression stroke. 
With the piston at TDC rotate the dial such 
that the needle aligns with zero on the dial 
gauge. 
Set the C.B. point gap at 0.35 to 0.4mm 
and rotate the crank shaft in the opposite 
direction such that the piston will be 0.8mm 
before TDC (This can measured on the dial 
gauge). Now reset the base plate so that the 
points just commenses to open. This can 
be checked by connecting a 12v bulb and 
the CB point in series with abattery. When 
the points are in contact the bulb Will glow 
and when they just open the bulb will not 
glow 
Lubrication (every 5,000 Kms.) 
Smear the surface of the cam very tightly 
with mobile grease No.2, non creep oil or 
clean engine oil. Apply a drop of clean engine 
oil on the contact breaker pivot. Make sure 11 
no grease or oil gets in between the contact 
points. 
8. Automatic Timing Control 
The automatic timing mechanism 
provided in the contact breaker housing 
helps in automatically advancing the 
ignition timing with relation to engine speed 
at higher RPM.

9. Spark Plug 
Owing to electrode burning, the electrode gap widens 
in operation and may impair the performance and 
economy of the motorcycle. Therefore, the electrodes 
should be cleaned and adjusted to its specified gap - 
i.e. 0.46 to 0.50 mm. Check the electrode gap every 
5,000 Km. and clean and adjust if necessary 
Spark Plug Type Ref. No.

10. Battery 
The battery is a 12 Volt. 5 or 5.5 Amp. hour capacity battery. Every week the filler cap of 
each cell should be unscrewed so that distilled water can be added to bring the acid level above 
the top of the seperators if found low. (For US/ Canada battery used is 12V 7 AH) 
DO NOT add tap water as this contains impurities. Acid should not be added unless this is 
accidentally spilled out of the battery. In case of spillage, it should be replaced by dilute sulphuric 
acid of the same specific gravity as in the cells. Keep the battery terminals clean, and free from 
corrosion by coating with pure vaseline (not grease). Many lighting troubles can be traced to 
unseen corrosion between the battery leads and the terminals in the battery. The corrosion 
takes place much more frequently at the battery terminals than at other electrical contacts. 
The state of charge of the battery is indicated by the specific gravity of its electrolyte. If 
specific gravity falls to 1.110, the battery must be recharged using an external D.C. supply at 
the normal recharge rate of 0.5 Amp. 
NOTE: If the battery is subjected to long periods of night parking with the lights on, it may 
be necessary to recharge the battery before using the motorcycle.

PARKING LIGHT 
11. Head Lamp 
A) Regular and UK Models 
The unit consists of a reflector and front lens assembly which are permanetly stuck together 
to prevent water and dust from entering inside and spoiling the reflector. 
A prefocus bulb is used, hence no focusing device is required to be fitted. The bulb has a 
large flange and cap. A slot in the flange helps in correctly positioning the bulb in the reflector. 
A spring loaded bulb holder, when assembled on the reflector ensures the bulb is held in 
position. 
The bulb is connected to the wiring harness with the help of lucar connectors. The bulb is 
12 V 40/45 watts. 
To replace the bulb in the light unit, loosen the top screw on the fixing rim and remove the 
front rim and light assembly taking care to disengage the lug at the bottom of the front rim 
from the fixing rim. Disconnect the lucar connectors from the bulb terminals. Gently press 
and twist the bulb holder in the anticlockwise direction to remove the bulb holder.Remove 
the bulb out of the reflector. 
Reassembly of the headlight bulb is the reverse order of the procedure mentioned above but 
care should be taken to locate the bulb and holder correctly in the reflector. 
In the event of damage to either the lens or the reflector. a new light unit must be fixed. 
To remove the light unit from the front rim, remove the securing spring clips holding the 
light unit to the rim and remove the light unit from the rim. 
While reassembling the light unit ensure the word 'top' on the lens is towards the top of the 
rim and secure the spring clips in the fixing rim ensuring that they are equally spaced around 
the rim. 
B) US/ Canada Models 
These models are fitted with an aiming device to meet the regulations in US and Canada. 
The light unit is a sealed beam. In the event of the head light bulb fusing the complete 
sealed beam needs to be replaced. 
The dismantling of the head light assembly in the same except that the sealed beam is 
located in the aiming device housing. The sealed beam is located on a spring loaded screw on 
one side and by means of 2 springs connected to the housing. 
12. Parking Lights 
Access to the parking bulbs is obtained by removing 
the parking lamp rim (see fig.). This forces over the 
edge of the rubber lamp body and is additionally 
secured by means of a small fixing screw. After removal 
of the lamp rim the parking lamp lens can be pulled 
out of the rubber body, after which the bulb will be 
accessible. 
Bulb - Parking Lamp - 12V - 2W 
67 
13. Stop and Tail Lamp 
The rear lamp is a combined stop and tail light and also incorporates a reflector. 
Access to the bulb is obtained by removing the two screws which secure the plastic cover. 
The correct bulb is 12 volt 6/18 Watt or 5/21 Watt. The 6 Watt filament provides the normal 
tail light, while the 18 Watt filament is illuminated by movement of the brake pedal and while 
operating front brake lever. 
Care must be taken while replacing a new tail light assy so that the leads to the stop tail 
lamp are correctly connected, as the use of the 18 Watt filament on the normal tail light will 
not only discharge the battery but could cause excessive heat affecting the plastic cover. At the 
same time, the 6 Watt filament, if used as stop light, will be ineffective in bright sunlight or at 
night when the tail light filament is illuminated. 
14) Horn 
The machine is fitted with a 12V x 3 Amps D.C. Horn. This is a sealed unit and should never 
be tampered with. A screw is provided with a locking nut at the back of the horn for tone 
adjustment. Do not meddle with it unless it requries adjustment. If the horn gives only a 
choking sound, or does not vibrate, it does not mean that the horn has broken down. The 
trouble may be due to a discharged battery, a loose connection, or short-circuit in the wiring of 
the horn. It is also possible that the performance of the horn may deteriorate due to its mounting 
becoming loose. 
HORN-FRONT VIEW HORN-REAR VIEW 
A - TONE ADJUSTING SCREW 
However a setting screw is provided which is covered by a protective rubber cap. "B" 
If the horn sound is feeble then minor corrections are possible by means of this setting 
screw. 
To carry out adjustments please proceed as follows: 
- Remove protective rubber cap 
- Turn in the small screw very carefully at the same time check for functioning of the 
• horn 
- Stop adjusting when the desired sound level is obtained. 
- Refit the protective rubber cap over screw when adjustment is complete. 
NOTE: IF the adjusting screw is turned in too much the horn would only give a choking 
sound or if it is turned out too much the sound would be very feeble.

CARBURETTOR 
Bullet Motorcycles are fitted with MIKCARB Carburettors 
350cc VM-24 Type 
500cc VM-28 Type 
Function 
The function of the carburettor is to provide combustible Air- fuel mixture by breaking the fuel 
into tiny particles - in the form of vapour and mixing the fuel vapour with air in a proper ratio and 
deliver it into the engine combustion chamber. 
In general, all carburettors are designed to provide the engine with the designed ratio of 
automised fuel-air mixture at the required quantity levels to cater to both load and road speed of 
engines. 
In the Mikcarb carburettors fitted to 350cc and 500cc Bullet Motorcycles, the automisation and 
mixing of fuel and air is carried out by THREE systems, viz.:- 
- STARTING JET SYSTEM or CHOKE SYSTEM 
— PILOT JET SYSTEM 
— MAIN JET SYSTEM 
STARTING JET SYSTEM 
1. Starting Jet System 
The starting jet system provided in this car-burettor 
is to aid starting, under adverse condi-tion 
such as that experienced during cold winter 
mornings. 
The starting jet system comes into operation, 
when the choke lever is pushed down and there-by 
lifting the choke plunger from its seat. This 
enables an additional quantity of fuel to be 
supplied to the engine in addition to that of pilot 
jet system. 
This action makes the fuel air mixture to 
become richer for better startability. 
75 
MAIN JET SYSTEM 
2. Pilot Jet System 
The pilot jet system supplies the engine requirements at lower engine speeds only, i.e. during 
idling rpm. This function is carried out by the pilot jet and pilot air screw. The pilot air screw 
governs the air fuel mixture ratio. Adjusting the screw by screwing in beyond the specified limits 
would make the mixture rich and vice versa. 
PILOT JET SYSTEM 
3. Main Jet System 
The main jet system comes into operation at 
speeds above idling, i.e. the moment throttle slide 
is lifted. When once the main jet system becomes 
functional, it provides to the by-pas circuit for the 
pilot jet system. As such, the pilot jet system be-comes 
'totally inoperative during main jet system 
operation. 
This main jet system comprises of the main jet, 
the needle jet and the taper needle. The fuel flows 
through the main jet (also known as metering jet) 
during the main jet operation. 
The taper needle, which is mounted on the 
throttle slide, while operated up and down in-creases 
or reduces the cross sectional area between 
the needle jet bore and the needle. This in turn 
monitors the quantity of atomised fuel supplied 
with respect to engine speed & load. 
76 
MIKCARB CARBURETTOR VM28 (500 C.C.) 
77 
MIKCARB CARBURETTOR (VM 24 - 350 CC) 
The taper needle shank has five grooves in it, so that, it can be set in relation to the throttle 
slide. If the needle is set higher on the throttle slide, the quantity of fuel that is being supplied 
would become much more, than if it would have been set at a lower position. However, it is to 
be noted thatt the fuel supplied is governed by the above mechanism only on part throttle 
condition. With the throttle fully opened, the fuel supplied is monitored by the main jet only. 
The recommended position for the Needle Lock is the 2nd or 3rd groove from bottom. 
4. Servicing 
The carburettor should be cleaned thoroughly with petrol only. Ensure that all parts are in 
serviceable condition. Before mounting the carburettor, always ensure that the slide is free to 
move up and down by operating the throttle twist grip. Also ensure that the starter piston 
(choke plunger) is properly set in position. 
CAUTION: Never user a sharp instrument or wire to clean the carburettor parts especially 
jets and passages. If the passages are blocked, use only pressurised air to clear the passages. 
Handle all parts gently and with great care. Run down all threaded attachments gently. Never 
use force. 
5. Mounting 
Special care must be exercised while mounting the carburettor. Ensure positioning of 
carburettor is vertical and the gasket, '0' Ring is serviceable, to prevent any air/gas leak. 
In 500cc models, Rubberised Inlet Manifold is fitted. To check the condition for any crack, 
or otherwise a cracked manifold will result in starting trouble and erratic idling speed. 
6. Setting Idling 
It is always recommended to set idling speed of the engine while the engine is still warm, i.e. 
after a short run. 
The procedure for setting idling speed is: 
a) Start the engine and warm up for 2 to 3 minutes. 
b) Turn the pilot air screw down to the bottom and reduce the engine RPM to the 
slowest rate, using the idle adjusting screw. 
c) Open out the air screw slowly and keep watch on engine speed. At a point, engine 
speed will increase. rind the position where the engine RPM is maximum and the 
engine firing uniform. This is normally between 2 to 3 half turns of the air screw 
(360° + 180° Turns) from its fully closed position. 
d) Now adjust the idling RPM once more with the idling screw. 
NOTE: 1. Take out any excessive play in the throttle cable. 
2. Turn the handle bar to left side & right side to ensure that the throttle cable is 
free and does not foul with anyother part in the routing of the cable. 
Besides the above two settings, no other settings to the carburettor is required for normal 
operating conditions.

• Worn out valve guide or valve stem 
• Piston, piston rings or cylinder 
wall worn out 
• Connecting rod bent

0 Use SAE 20w - 50 oil 
0 Replace valve guide and valve 
0 Replace the worn out parts 
0 Replace the connecting rod 
0 Fit the ring correctly 
No white smoke 
The oil consumption will then be OK. 
NOTES : Oil seepage into crank case when engine is at rest, results in the flywheel dipping through the 
accumulated oil. When engine is started the resultant excessive oil splash causes oil escape through 
breather during the first few minutes of engine operation. 
b) Failure of return pump causes excessive oil accumulation in crank case throughout engine operation. 
The fly wheels dip through it. Excessive splash thus caused ends up with continuous oil through from 
the breather. 
c) Excessive blow-by results in excessive gas flow through the crank case to the breather. The flowing gas 
picks up the splashed oil at the crank case. This ends up with continuous oil throw from the breather. 
86 
COMPLAINT : HIGH LUB OIL CONSUMPTION 
d) Method of checking oil circulation : 
1 Remove the tappet Inspection door. Continuous oil flow through the push rod while the engine is in 
operation indicates proper oil circulation. 
2 Loosen the banjo union at the cylinder head. Engine in idling, oil flow from this joint indicates prOper oil 
circulation upto this point. 
3 While engine is idlling, loosen the feed plug. Solid oil flow from here indicates proper functioning of feed 
pump. 
e) Method of finding oil leaks to crankcase from cork seal, crank shaft timing end bush & joint between 
crank case and oil tank : 
1 Keep the motor cycle on a level ground. 
2 Remove the return pump filter plug and drain the oil completely from crank case chamber / flywheel 
chamber. 
3 Check and top up oil in tank to 'H' mark on dip stick. 
4 Refit the return pump filter plug. 
5 Keep the motor cycle in this way for 24 Hrs. During this period do not crank or start the motor cycle. 
6 Now, remove the return pump filter plug and collect the oil that may drain from the crank case in a bow. 
If no oil is draining, there is no leakage from oil tank and timing chest to crank case. 
7 If oil get collected and oil level in sump is unchanged then leakage is from T chest. 
f) Method of checking return pump operation : 
1 Ride the vehicle for one or two kms or start and run the engine for 10 mts. 
2 Keep the motor cycle on stand and switch off the engine. 
3 Remove the return pump filter plug and collect the draining oil in a bowl. 
4 About 50 to 75 ml oil will normally be there to drain. If oil drained measure more than 100 ml, operation 
of return pump can be suspected.

FOREWORD 
PREPARATION FOR SERVICE 
Good preparation is very important for efficient service work. A clean work area at the start of 
each job will allow you to perform the repair as easily and quickly as possible, and will reduce the 
incidents of misplaced tools and parts. A motorcycle that is excessively dirty should be cleaned 
before work starts. Cleaning will occasionally uncover sources of trouble. Tools, instruments and 
any parts needed for the job should be gathered before work is started. Interrupting a job to 
located tools or parts is an unnecessary distraction and causes needless delay. Tools required 
for special service work are listed in Section 02. 
USE OF GENUINE REPLACEMENT PARTS 
When replacement parts are required, use only genuine Royal Enfield parts. Failure to do so 
may result in product malfunction and possible injury to the driver and or passenger. 
SERVICE BULLETINS 
In addition to the information presented in this Service Manual, Royal Enfield will periodically 
issue Technical Service Bulletins. These Bulletins cover interim engineering changes and 
supplementary information.

SECTION THREE 03 
ES ENGINE 
CONFIGURATION 
PRINCIPLE OF ELECTRIC 
START 
There is a 'Starter motor assembly' which is 
connected to the 'engine sprocket' on crank shaft, 
through a series of gears and Sprag clutch'. This 
starter motor is driven by a powerful 12 V 14 Ah 
battery. 
`Sprag clutch' is a mechanism which allows the 
starter motor torque to pass through it to the crank 
shaft, when the crank shaft rpm is less than the 
motor rpm, but starts to slip once the crank shaft 
rpm is higher than the starter motor rpm. When 
the engine is started, the starter motor's torque 
will have no effect on the crank shaft. Once 
Engine is started, the battery connection to starter 
motor cuts off on releasing the starter switch. 
Battery is connected to the starter motor through 
the 'relay starter switch'. 
A conventional switch will not be in position to 
withstand very high current and hence relay 
starter switch is used. 
WORKING PRINCIPLE 
When the ignition switch is switched 'ON', 
electric supply from the relay starter is made 
available at the engine starting switch on the RH 
side of Handle bar. When this is pressed, relay 
starter is activated and it connects Battery with 
starter motor thus starting the engine.

SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM TCI SYSTEM 
TCI (TRANSISTORIZED 
COIL IGNITION) SYSTEM 
-A The TCI is an advance & intelligent ignition 
system works on DC supply. It requires 7 
Volt minimum DC supply from battery to 
start the engine. 
1,t- The principle of transistorized coil ignition 
is 'Inductive' type. 
-A The TCI system has a strong spark 
intensity & long arc duration to ensure total 
combustion. 
THE TCI CONSTITUTES THE 
FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 
Fly wheel magneto with built in reluctor 
06-1 
• TCI (positioned underneath the seat). 
-A High inductive HT coil 
-A Integral Rectifier and Regulator unit. 
• Stator and Pulsar coil assembly 
For Checking Procedure refer 
Electricals (Section 12, Page No. 12) 
-A- Battery 12V 14 Ah for Electric Start 
Battery 12V 5Ah for Kick Start 
WORKING PRINCIPLE OF 
TCI 
As the crankshaft rotates, the reluctor peg inserts 
in the rotor (Permanent magnet) cuts the pulsar 
coil magnetic field & according to the law of 
induction generates voltage,which triggers 
switching of TCI unit and in turn disturbs the 
supply to primary ignition coil, thus inducing a 
high voltage in the secondary winding which 
distributed to the spark plug. The energy supplied 
to the primary coil is from the Battery. 
THE ADVANTAGES OF THE 
TCI 
The major advantage is the spark duration 
0.7-0.8 milliseconds. This ensures 
complete combustion of the air—fuel 
mixture under all operating condition. 
-A Improved ignition of lean mixture because 
of high intensity of spark. 
-A Good startability. 
-A Lesser electrical disturbance noise. 
'A Good battery charging even at lower RPM. 
A Better reliability of the entire electrical 
system. 
A Maintenance free ignition system. 
-A- Solid state TCI ignition avoids wear of 
contact breaker.

IGNITION (CDI) SYSTEM 
The Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) is 
commonly known as Electronic Ignition System. 
The Operating concept of the CDI differs from 
the conventional CB point ignition system.The 
CDI operates more precisely than a CB points 
system wherein the Ignition process is triggered 
from the pulser coil that is attached to the stator, 
instead of from the distributor. This eliminates 
the need for regular maintenance, adjustments 
to CB point and base plate which is housed in 
the distributor and also avoids the mechanical 
slackness that could cause inconsistent ignitions. 
WORKING PRINCIPLE 
The salient feature of a CDI system is that it stores 
an electrical energy in a capacitor. This stored 
energy is discharged at the appropriate time from 
the capacitor into the HT coil as the primary 
voltage, The HT coil converts this primary voltage 
to the required high voltage to the spark plug. 
The electronic Ignition consists of a pluser coil, 
a reluctor and a CDI unit. The pulser coil is 
located in the stator assembly and the reluctor 
is fixed on the drive side of the crankshaft. When 
the crankshaft rotates, the current generated gets 
stored in the capacitor located in the CDI unit. 
When the reluctor cuts across the magnetic field 
of the pulser coil, an electrical pulse from the 
pulser coil triggers a transistor, which releases 
the capacitor's stored energy into the primary 
circuit in the HT coil. The secondary circuit in the 
HT coil then converts this energy into the required 
high voltage (20,000 to 25,000 volts) for an 
efficient spark through the spark plug.

Advantage of capacitor discharge ignition 
system : 
• Higher and consistent voltage for a better

• No moving parts except the reluctor. 
Ensures a consistent performance as 
there is no wear and tear or deterioration 
of parts. 
"A- The ignition timing is adjustment free, since 
it does not get altered on its own or due to 
mechanical wear. 
* Prolonged life of the battery as the 
electrical energy required for ignition is 
provided directly by the alternator. 
1;1- Eliminates recurring maintenance cost of 
replacing the CB point and Condenser. 
- IA- No starting trouble since the CDI removes 
the biggest irritant of water getting into the 
CB point during washing or riding during 
rains.

FUNCTIONS OF 
CARBURETOR 
CARBURETOR PERFORMS THREE 
IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS : 
A It varies the air-fuel ratio according to the 
operating conditions and requirements of 
the engine. 
A It produces a mixture which is properly 
atomized. Atomization is the mixing of air 
and fuel to form a fine spray or mist and to 
deliver the mixture to the engine. 
A It regulates the amount of air - fuel mixture 
required by the engine. 
In order to meet the requirements for the 
proper mixture ratio under varying 
conditions the following systems are being 
used in Butterfly slide (BS) type 
carburetors. 
1.1 Fuel Inlet and Float System 
1.2 Starter System 
1.3 Pilot System (Slow Speed System) 
1.4 Main System (High Speed System) 
1.1. FUEL INLET AND 
FLOAT SYSTEM 
This system consists of the bowl, float and 
needle valve. Fuel from the tank enters into the 
bowl through the float system from where it is 
metered for the engine requirement. The fuel 
level in the bowl is maintained by the float system. 
The float system is a very important part of the 
main, pilot and starter circuits. The fuel level in 
the bowl must be high enough to reach them. 
But even more significantly the fuel level actually 
effects how rich or leaner the engine runs 
through its entire range. A higher fuel level will 
enrich the mixture causing excessive fuel 
consumption and poor running. On the other 
hand, a low fuel level can be even more serious 
due to leaning effect it has. This may result in flat 
spot when accelerating out of turn or in extreme 
cases, the engine could overheat and seize. A 
high or low fuel level is due to an incorrectly 
adjusted float. 
The float height can be measured with the 
float bowl removed and the carburetor inverted 
with the float tongue just touching the needle 
valve. The float should be only resting and not 
compressing the spring loaded float valve needle. 
The distance "A" should be equal to the specified

float level depending on the carburetor type. This 
height can be adjusted by bending the float 
tongue. If the float height is more then the 
specification, bend the tongue away from the 
needle valve. If less than specification, bend it 
towards the needle valve. It should always be 
remembered that a high float level results in a 
low fuel level and a low float level results in a 
high fuel level. 
1.2. STARTER SYSTEM 
In addition to the air-fuel mixture problems 
of low-speed engine operation, cold engine 
starting presents yet another problem. The 
engine parts are not hot enough to vaporize the 
droplets of fuel. This additional difficulty requires 
an even richer mixture than that provided by the 
pilot system. To provide this richer mixture, a 
starter circuit is added to the carburetor. The 
starter circuit consists of a starter jet to meter 
the fuel and a plunger that opens an air passage 
from the inlet of the carburetor underneath the 
diaphragm and the mixture then passes to the 
manifold. 
The plunger is lifted by a cable or lever, as 
the plunger lifts off its seat, it uncovers a fuel 
passage that leads to the starter jet. Lifting the 
plunger further uncovers the air-inlet passage and 
the outlet to the manifold. The outlet to the venture 
is on the engine side of the throttle valve. With 
the throttle valve closed (as it should be for 
starting), almost all the air that goes to the engine 
must pass through the starter passage. This 
creates enough suction to draw fuel up from the 
bowl into the chamber below the plunger. Here 
the fuel is mixed with the air and the mixture is 
drawn into the engine. Atomization of the mixture 
is aided by an emulsion tube. This tube has holes 
drilled in the sides similar to those in the pilot jet. 
These holes allow a small amount of air from 
the float chamber to be mixed with the fuel before 
it enters the chamber below the starter plunger. 
The purpose of its atomization is to foam the fuel 
slightly allowing it to flow more easily through the 
small passage. 
1.3. PILOT SYSTEM (SLOW 
SPEED SYSTEM) 
The pilot system provides the air-fuel 
mixture at idling and at small throttle openings 
when not enough air is being drawn through the 
carburetor to cause the main system to operate. 
The pilot circuit consists of a pilot jet to meter 
fuel, two pilot air jets one located in the top part

of the carburetor body underneath the diaphragm 
and another in the inlet side near the main air jet, 
and a pilot screw to control the amount of air-fuel 
mixture flowing through the pilot outlet. 
Fuel is metered by pilot jet (PJ) and air 
volume is metered by pilot air jets (PAJ1 & PAJ2) 
and the mixture is discharged through the pilot 
outlet and bypass ports. The pilot outlet is located 
on the manifold side of the carburetor and the 
bypass ports are just covered by the butterfly 
throttle valve. Since the throttle valve is almost 
at full close, air-fuel mixture is supplied mainly 
by pilot outlet and some also from bypass port 
#1. Air-fuel mixture is adjusted by pilot screw (PS) 
and mixture becomes lean when PS is tightened 
(PS turned clockwise) and rich when it is 
loosened (PS turned anticlockwise). When the 
throttle valve is opened from idling, air-fuel 
mixture is supplied mainly from pilot outlet and 
bypass port but some is also discharged from 
main system that forms primary venture (through 
a clearance between jet needle and needle jet). 
MAIN SYSTEM 
(HIGH SPEED SYSTEM) 
This system consists of jet needle, needle 
jet and main jet to assist in atomization. An air 
bleed circuit is reincorporated in the main 
metering system and it aids fuel vaporization by 
introducing the air into the fuel before it enters 
the air stream. 
The constant velocity carburetor uses a 
butterfly throttle valve located closer to the engine 
in the carburetor body to regulate engine speed. 
The slide in a CV carburetor moves in direct 
proportion to the engine demand. This assures 
the correct venture size and air velocity 
throughout the midrange.operation of the engine. 
The constant velocity carburetor uses 
venture vacuum to control slide movement. This 
is accomplished with a rubber diaphragm that is 
attached to the top of the carburetor slide. The 
diaphragm separates two chambers. One 
chamber, below the diaphragm is vented to the 
atmospheric pressure. The other chamber, 
above the diaphragm is exposed to the venture 
air pressure by an air passage through the slide 
itself. At idle, a spring keeps the slide closed. 
When the throttle valve is opened and air 
flow through the venture increases, the air 
pressure in the venture (and the upper chamber) 
decreases. As the atmospheric pressure in the 
bottom chamber is greater than the venture 
pressure above the diaphragm, the slide is 
pushed up and more air-fuel mixture is drawn 
into the engine. When the throttle valve is closed, 
air flow through the venture decreases; air 
pressure in the venture increases and 
approaches atmospheric pressure, and the 
spring pushes the slide back down. 
The midrange circuit is actually a 
combination of circuits that work together to 
achieve correct air-fuel mixture. The pilot circuit 
is still operational but its contribution to the total 
air-fuel mixtures is relatively small. The jet needle 
is a tapered needle attached to the piston valve 
which points downward, through the center of 
08-4 
carburetor venture. The tapered end of the jet 
needle fits into the needle jet broach which is 
located in the carburetor body. 
The jet needle virtually blocks the needle 
jet when the piston slide is in the closed (idle) 
position. As the slide is lifted the tapered section 
of the needle rises out of the needle jet, thus 
increasing the clearance between them and 
allowing more fuel to flow. With the piston valve 
raised, the increased airflow creates a sufficient 
pressure drop to draw more fuel from the float 
bowl and through the needle jet. At approximately 
three-quarter lift of piston valve, the clearance 
area between the jet needle and the needle jet 
becomes greater than the area of the main jet. 
At this point, the fuel flow is determined primarily 
by the size of the main jet. 
The position of the jet needle relative to the 
needle jet determines the amount of fuel flowing 
through the clearance between them, changing 
the position of the jet needle relative to the slide 
changes the air-fuel mixture. The jet needle is 
moved relative to the slide by changing the 
position of the E-ring up or down in the grooves 
on the jet needle. Moving the E-ring towards the 
top of the needle has the effect of reducing the 
fuel flow, thus leaning out the mixture. Bringing 
the E-ring towards the lower grooves will have 
the effect of richening the mixture.

MAINTENANCE TIPS 
-A The maintenance of the carburetor is 
merely a question of cleaning periodically 
in order to avoid blockage of jets and 
channels. 
-A Maintaining a full tank of petrol doesn't allow 
fuel tank to rust and there by reduces rust 
deposits in the carburetors. 
-A Drain the carburetor every three thousand 
Kms by removing the drain screw to drain 
all the deposits at the bottom of the float 
bowl. 
.* When using the choke do not open the 
throttle as it may cause flooding. 
-A Clean Air-filter regularly, as a blocked or 
damaged air-filter will have an adverse 
effect on both the carburetor as well as the 
engine performance. 
SERVICE GUIDELINES 
Spray carburetor cleaner in all passages 
to ensure that there is no blockage due to 
dust, dirt, gum or carbon deposit, especially 
in the main air passage, pilot air passages, 
including by-pass holes and pilot outlet. 
While re-assembling dismantled 
carburetors, always replace the old 
gaskets and o-ring with new ROYAL 
ENFIELD genuine spares. 
Cleaning of jets should be done only with 
the help of carburetor cleaner and 
compressed air. 
-A Check the float height and ensure that it is 
as per specifications. 
.1;f Ensure that the pilot jet is not tightened 
beyond the specified torque as this will 
cause the head to shear and removal of 
the jet from the mixing body becomes 
nearly impossible. 
08-6 
?o Do not tamper with the e-ring position of 
the jet needle or change the sizes of the 
jets in order to attain better mileage or 
power as this will have adverse effect on 
the engine performance and lead to pre-mature 
wear of engine parts. 
Ensure that the seating area of the choke 
plunger assembly is not worn or damaged. 
If worn or damaged, replace the plunger 
assembly.

WORKING PRINCIPLE OF 
SECONDARY AIR VALVE 
* The exhaust of the engine consists of three 
polluting gasses namely carbon monoxide 
(CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of 
nitrogen. For controlling CO and HC, 
oxidation reaction has to be promoted. The 
secondary air valve provides the oxygen 
required for oxidation reaction. 
-A The exhaust of the engine will have positive 
and negative pressure pulses. Utilising 
these negative pressure pulses, air is 
drawn from the air cleaner and admitted in 
to the exhaust through a reed valve. When 
there is a positive pressure, reed closes 
and prevents exhaust from entering the 
system. 
‘ The air suction valve is provided with air 
cut valve system to cut-off the air supply 
during deceleration to prevent after burn. 
TROUBLE SHOOTING 
-A The only method of verifying the functioning 
of ASV is to compare the vehicle exhaust 
CO% at idle condition with and without the 
ASV.

FUNCTIONS OF 
CARBURETOR 
CARBURETOR PERFORMS THREE 
IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS : 
A It varies the air-fuel ratio according to the 
operating conditions and requirements of 
the engine. 
A It produces combustible air fuel mixture by 
atomization. Atomization is the mixing of 
air and fuel to form a fine spray of mist. 
A It regulates the amount of air - fuel mixture 
required by the engine. 
In order to meet the varying requirements 
for proper mixture ratio the following 
systems are being used in VM carburetors. 
1.1 Fuel Inlet and Float System 
1.2 Starter System 
1.3 Pilot System (Slow Speed System) 
1.4 Main System (High Speed System) 
1.1. FUEL INLET AND 
FLOAT SYSTEM 
This system consists of a bowl, float and 
needle valve. Fuel from the tank is entering into 
the bowl through the float system from where it 
is metered for the engine requirement, by 
maintaining the correct fuel level. 
The higher fuel level will richen mixture 
causing excessive fuel consumption and poor 
running. On the other hand, a low fuel level can 
be even more serious due to leaning effect. This 
may result in flat spot when accelerating or in 
extreme cases, the engine could overheat and 
seize. 
A high or low fuel level is due to an 
incorrectly adjusted float height. For measuring 
the height remove the float bowl and carburetor 
and ensure that the float tongue is touching the 
needle valve. The float should only resting on and 
09-2 
:,••:•?;} •• • •;•• 
-"'•-• • 
not compressing the spring loaded float valve 
needle. The float height should be equal to the 
specified float level depending on the carburetor 
type. This height can be adjusted by bending the 
float tongue. If the float height is more than the 
specification, bend it towards the needle valve. It 
should always be remembered that a high float 
level results in a low fuel level and a low float 
level results in a high fuel level. (Ref Page-10 for 
float height measuring procedure) 
1.2. STARTER SYSTEM 
At the time of cold starting, the engine parts 
are not hot enough to vaporize the droplets of 
fuel. Hence, a richer mixture than that provided 
by the pilot system is required at the time of cold 
starting. To provide this mixture, a starter circuit 
is added to the carburettor. 
A The starter circuit consists of a starter jet 
to meter the fuel and a plunger. 
A The plunger is operated by a cable or lever. 
As the Plunger is lefted off its seat, it 
uncovers a fuel passage that leads to 
starter jet. Lifting the plunger further 
uncovers the air inlet passage. 
-A With the piston valve fully closed almost 
all the air that goes to the engine must pass 
through the starter passage. This creates 
enough suction to draw fuel up from the 
bowl into the chamber below the plunger. 
Here the fuel is mixed with the air and the 
rich mixture is drawn into the engine at the 
time of cold starting. 
1.3. PILOT SYSTEM (SLOW 
SPEED SYSTEM) 
-A The pilot system provides the air-fuel 
mixture in idling and at small throttle 
openings when the main system is not in 
operation. 
-A Fuel from the bowl is metered by the pilot 
jet and mixed with the air, adjusted properly 
by the air screw. The atomized fuel 
reaches the venturi through the pilot outlet 
and mixed with the air flowing through the 
main bore. The pilot outlet is located on the 
manifold side of the carubretor and is just 
covered by the piston valve wall. Since the 
piston valve is almost closed at idling the 
pilot outlet is only partially exposed to the 
manifold vacuum. Hence it gives minimum 
09 3 
fuel just to run the engine. When the piston 
valve is raised from idling, pilot outlet is fully 
exposed to the manifold vacuum and 
supplies fuel to its full extent which is 
sufficient to meet the engine requirement 
at slow speed. 
MAIN SYSTEM 
(HIGH SPEED SYSTEM) 
'A This system consists of jet needle, needle 
jet and main jet to assist in atomization. 
An air bleed circuit is incorporated in the 
main metering system and it aids fuel 
vaporization by introducing the air into the 
fuel before it enters the air stream. 
• For VM type the midrange circuit is actually 
a combination of circuits that work together 
to achieve correct air-fuel mixture. The pilot 
circuit is still operational but its contribution 
to the total air-fuel mixture is relatively less. 
The jet needle is a tapered needle attached 
to the piston valve which points downward, 
through the center of carburetor venturi. 
The tapered end of the jet needle moves 
inside the needle jet which is located in the 
carburetor body. 
- The position of the jet needle relative to the 
needle jet determines the amount of fuel 
flowing through the opening between them. 
Changing the position of the jet needle 
relative to the slide (piston valve) changes 
the air-fuel mixture. The jet needle is moved 
relative to the slide by changing the piston 
of the E-ring up or down in the grooves on 
the jet needle. Moving the E-ring towards 
the top of the needle has the effect of 
reducing the fuel flow, thus leaning out of 
the mixture. Bringing the E-ring towards the 
lower groves will have the effect of 
richening the mixture. 
DISASSEMBLY 
Unscrew the top cover and remove the 
piston valve spring and piston valve 
assembly from the carburetor. 
- Generally, it is not advisable to remove the 
jet needle. if it is necessary, un screw the 
jet needle. 
• Unscrew the guide holder assembly by 
using the right size spanner and remove 
the plunger along with the spring. 
-A- Unscrew the mixture control screw along 
with its spring, plate washer and o-ring. 
Unscrew the float body fixing screws and 
remove the float body from the mixing body. 
If it is absolutely necessary, unscrew the 
float toggle pin retaining spring and remove 
the float along with the needle valve. 
Unscrew the pilot jet, main jet and main jet 
holder from the mixing body. 
Remove the needle jet from the mixing 
body only if it is necessary. 
Unscrew the drain screw from the float 
body. 
09-4 
* Unscrew the coasting richer cover fixing 
screw and remove the diaphragm (if 
applicable). 
ASSEMBLING PROCEDURE 
* Follow the reverse sequence of 
disassembling procedure. 
* While assembling the jet needle ensure that 
the jet needle ring pin coincides with the 
corresponding hole in piston valve. 
* When fixing the needle jet ensure that the 
correct concentricity to main jet holder hole 
is maintained. 
* When assembling the coasting richer 
assembly position the diaphragm in the two 
locating pins.

GAS FILLED SHOCK 
ABSORBER 
WORKING PRINCIPLE 
A The pressure of the nitrogen/Air, in the 
reserve tube of a gas charged shock 
varies from 75 to 120 psi, depending on 
the amount of fluid in the reserve tube. The 
gas serves several important functions to 
improve the ride control characteristics of 
the shock absorbers. 
A The main function is to increase the 
resistance of fluid flow into the reserve tube. 
This improves valving performance during 
the beginning of rebound stroke. 
- Another function is to minimize aeration of 
the shock absorber's hydraulic fluid. The 
pressure of the nitrogen gas / air prevents 
air bubbles or foam from weakening the 
hydraulic effectiveness of fluid flow through 
both the piston and base valve systems. 
Foam affects performance since foam 
compresses, fluid does not. This is 
alternatively called as cavitation. The effect 
of foaming will result in poor riding 
comfort.

Avoid spilling of brake fluid on painted, 
plastics or rubber parts. Place a rag over 
these parts whenever the system is 
serviced, to avoid direct contact with brake 
fluid. Brake fluid is a paint stripper and 
reacts with these parts. 
Brake parts especially rubber components 
should not be cleaned using mineral oil, 
paint thinner or any other petroleum based 
liquids 
While servicing the brake, care should be 
taken to avoid the Disc/ Friction pad surface 
getting contact with oil or grease, as it may 
deteriorate brake system performance to

BATTERY PROBLEMS 
SULPHATION 
The active materials in the plates are 
converted into lead sulphate during 
discharge. This lead sulphate is 
reconverted to active materials during 
recharge. If the battery remains in 
discharged condition for long periods or 
excess quantity of acid is used in the 
electolyte, the lead sulphate is converted 
to hard crystalline substance. This is 
sulphation. 
Sulphated batteries do not take normal 
charging i.e, during charging the lead 
sulphate will not get reconverted to active 
materials. such batteries may show normal 
voltage without load, but do not not take 
load. 
HYDRATION 
The positive and negative plates remain 
submerged in electrolyte. However, when 
electrolyte level is less than the minimum 
indicate, the active materials on the plate 
get exposed to atmospheric air. The active 
materials, then reacts with water vapour 
of the atmosphedre, forming white spots 
on the plate. This is hydration. 
Hydration reduces the active area on the 
plates for chemical reaction. This reduces 
battery capacity. 
SHEDDING 
The active materials of the plates falling off 
is shedding . Over charging and rough 
handling are the main cause buckling 
plates, rendering the battery unserviceable. 
Over charging means charging of the 
battery with excessive current. 
COMMON PROBLEM 
EXPERIENCED IN FIELD 
A. CORROSION OF POSITIVE GRIDS 
- CAUSES 
* Improper Impurities in water/ acid [like CI, 
Mn, Fe.] 
INDICATIONS 
* setting of voltage and current regulator 
leading to overcharging / undercharging 
* Operating at high temperature 
* Too frequent topping up 
* Abnormal rise in electrolyte temperature 
* Excessive Gases 
EFFECT 
* Positive plates gets heavily corroded & 
become weak and disintegrate 
* Water in the electrolyte decomposers into 
hydrogen and oxygen and the electrolyte 
becomes concentrated 
* Separator gets damaged due to high 
temperature and impurities. 
CORRECTIVE ACTION 
* Replace RR Unit 
* Not to use local spurious rectifiers 
* Usage of only battery grade distilled water/ 
DM water for top up. 
* Usage of battery grade acid for filling 
B. SULPHATION - CAUSES 
* Deep discharge 
* Lack of charge due to low regulator setting 
* Self discharge due to idling 
A Low electrolyte level 
A Impurities like Fe, Cu, Mn. 
INDICATIONS 
-A Decrease in capacity indicated by weak 
horn and dim lights 
-A Lower cell voltage 
A Lower specific gravity 
-A Milky electrolyte colour 
-A Increase in self discharge due to (a) 
Impurities, (b) Idling 
A Plates at the top getting exposed and 
sulphated. 
EFFECTS 
-A Formation of sulphates in the plates 
A Sulphation causes hardening of plates 
A Treeing / shorting through separator 
A The plates exposed get sulphated and 
hardened and become active. 
CORRECTIVE ACTION 
A Replace RR unit 
A Periodical check up of battery for bench 
charging 
A Usage of battery grade acid for filling 
A Usage of battery grade distilled water/ DM 
water for topping up. 
A Periodic topping up to prevent exposure of 
plates. 
A If the battery is idle for longer duration it is 
necessary to boost charge before reuse 
to compensate for self discharge. 
SPARK PLUG 
Spark Plug is a vital part of ignition system. 
They are subjected to high combustion 
pressure (arounf 40 times the atmospheric 
pressure), intense heat (more than 2000 
deg. C. temperature) and severe vibration. 
Use of specified spark plug is therefore 
very important for good performance of an 
engine.

2. Electra MICO W145ZI 
3. Electra ES 
4. 500cc 
5. Machismo MICOSuperW5DC 
6. Thunderbird 
HEAT RANGE 
The spark plug is selected such that its 
electrodes with-stand the operating 
temperatures of the engine - hot enough 
to prevent fouling but cold enough to avoid 
auto ignition. 
HOT PLUG 
Spark plug with 8 large insulator tip surface 
area. Central electrode remains hotter. 
12-7 
COLD PLUG 
Spark plug with less insulator tip surface 
central electrode cools faster. 
Vehicle Usage Spark plug 
recommended 
1. Normal driving, 
both in city and 
highway 
Normal 
recommendation 
2. Mostly stop and 
go city driving 
Use hotter plug 
3. Mostly heavy 
loading, 
sustained high 
speed 
Use colder plug.

SPARK PLUG 
MAINTENANCE 
A Neglecting the spark plug maintenance 
eventually leads to difficult starting and poor 
performance. If the spark is used for a long 
period, the electrode gradually burns away 
and carbon builds up along the inside part. 
Once in 3000 kms or earlier, the plug 
should be removed for inspection, cleaning 
and resetting the gap. 
Carbon deposits on the spark plug 
establishes a 'shunt' between center and 
earth electrodes, that prevents good 
sparking and causes misfiring. Clean the 
deposits off periodically, with a spark plug 
cleaning tool / machine. 
-A Check spark plug for worn out earth and 
center electrodes. If the earth electrode has 
worn off to a knife edge and center electrode 
has reduced in height, replace it with new. 
INSPECTION 
-A Clean the electrodes and set gap to 
0.7mm. 
-A Clean the plug in a 'Spark plug cleaner cum 
Tester' 
-A Test the plug for proper sparking in the 
tester

smoke. If white 
smoke is 
observed, 
remove the 
rocker oil pipe 
banjo (2 Nos.) 
and bend the 
pipe away from 
the engine. 
Keep a clean 
tray below the 
pipe. Now start 
and check for 
the smoke. 
a) Excessive white smoke Oil enters the combustion 
chamber from the crankcase. 
7A- Wrong grade / recycled lub oil 
Worn out piston rings, piston 
or cylinder wall 
* Wrong fitment of piston rings

b. No smoke with rocker oil pipe in place go to check 3 
13-6 
NOTES: 
A- Failure of return pump causes excessive 
oil accumulation in crank case throughout 
engine operation. The fly wheels dip though 
it. Excessive splash thus caused ends up 
with oil entry to combustion chamber and 
white smoke. 
METHOD OF CHECKING OIL 
CIRCULATION 
A Open the oil tank cap. Keep the engine low 
idling. The sound of oil flow to the tank, 
indicates oil circulation. 
-A Remove the tappet inspection door. 
Continuous oil flow through the push rod 
tunnel while the engine is in operation 
indicates proper oil circulation. 
-A Loosen the banjo union at the cylinder head 
while the engine running in low idle. Oil flow 
from this joint indicates proper oil 
circulation upto this point. 
WHITE SMOKE 
Lubricating oil leakage to combustion 
chamber shows up as white smoke. 
Lubrication oil can enter the combustion 
chamber from: 
A The top through valve, valve guide and 
cylinder head. 
A The bottom between cylinder bore and 
piston rings. 
Check to find out whether the oil enters the 
combustion chamber from the top or 
bottom: 
-A Remove the rocker oil pipe banjos (two 
nos) and bend the pipe away from the 
engine. 
A Keep a clean tray below the pipe. 
-A- Start and run the engine. 
A- If white smoke stops, the oil enters the 
combustion chamber from the top. 
A If white smoke continues, the oil entry to 
the combustion chamber is from the 
bottom. 
CHECK FOR OIL LEAKAGE AT VALVE 
GUIDE: 
A Open the rocker cover. 
A Start and warm up the engine. 
A Keep the engine at 1500 rpm. 
-A Pour some engine oil on to the valve. 
IA Observe the smoke. 
'* Increased white smoke indicates oil leak 
between valve and valve guides. 
CHECK FOR OIL LEAKAGE 
BETWEEN CYLINDER BORE AND 
PISTON RINGS: 
A Remove the cylinder head. 
-A Clean and dry the piston top. 
-A Crank the engine several times and check 
for oil seepage from the bottom onto the 
piston crown. 
• Oil seepage onto the piston crown indicates 
oil leakage from bottom between cylinder 
bore and piston rings.

FOREWORD 
PREPARATION FOR SERVICE 
Good preparation is very important for efficient service work. A clean work area at the start of 
each job will allow you to perform the repair as easily and quickly as possible, and will reduce the 
incidents of misplaced tools and parts. A motorcycle that is excessively dirty should be cleaned 
before work starts. Cleaning will occasionally uncover sources of trouble. Tools, instruments and 
any parts needed for the job should be gathered before work is started. Interrupting a job to 
located tools or parts is an unnecessary distraction and causes needless delay. Tools required 
for special service work are listed in Section 02. 
USE OF GENUINE REPLACEMENT PARTS 
When replacement parts are required, use only genuine Royal Enfield parts. Failure to do so 
may result in product malfunction and possible injury to the driver and or passenger. 
SERVICE BULLETINS 
In addition to the information presented in this Service Manual, Royal Enfield will periodically 
issue Technical Service Bulletins. These Bulletins cover interim engineering changes and 
supplementary information.

LUBRRICATION SYSTEM 
OIL FLOW CHART 
A The oil in the lubrication system has several functions. It lubricates, seals, cools, 
cleans and prevents surface corrosion of internal parts of the engine. The use of 
the right engine oil is crucial to the performance and life of the engine. The oil 
grade to be used in engine is : 
A Grade : 15W - 40W 
A API performance rating : SG 
-A The lubrication system is called dry sump, pressure free lubrication system. Oil is stored in 
a tank. A feed pump draws the oil from the tank and supplies it to the crank shaft and cam 
spindles. Cylinder wall gets lubricated by oil splash from the rotating crank pin. 
From the lubricated points, the oil flows down to the crank case sump. 
The return pump, pumps oil from the crankcase sump and lubricates rockers, rocker spindles, 
valves, and valve guide. Oil flows down due to gravity through a hole on a timing chest. 
Return pump is larger in size and has higher delivery capacity compared to feed pump. 
This arrangement ensures that the crank case periodically remians dry the engine operation.

RUNNING IN 
Proper running-in is very important for achieving the maximum life and performance of the new vehicle 
for the period between zero and 1,000 km. 
The following guideliness explain proper running-in procedures. Since the engine is brand new, it 
should not be loaded excessiverly for the first 1,000 km. The various parts in the engine wear and 
polish themselves to the correct operating clearances. During this period, prolonged full throttle 
operation, or any condition, which might result in excessive heating of the engine, must be avoided. 
1. 0-150KM : 
Avoid operation above 1/3 throttle. Stop the engine and let it cool for 5 to 10 minutes after every 
hour of operation. Vary the speed of the Motorcycle from time to time. Do not operate it at one 
set throttle position. The recommended speed limit is 40-50 kmph. 
2. 150-500 KM : 
Avoid prolonged operation above 1/2 throttle. 
The recommended speed limit is 50-60 kmph. 
3. 500-1,000 KM : 
Avoid cruising speeds in excess of 3 / 4 throttle. 
The recommended speed limit is 70-80 kmph. 
e44(4:0* : 
After 500km of operation, be sure to replace the engine oil. 
4. 1,000 KM AND BEYOND : 
Avoid prolonged full-throttle operation. Vary speed occasionally.

SECTION FIVE 05 
500CC ES ENGINE 
CONFIGURATION 
PRINCIPLE OF ELECTRIC 
START 
There is a 'Starter motor assembly' which is 
connected to the 'engine sprocket' on crank shaft, 
through a series of gears and Sprag clutch'. This 
starter motor is driven by a powerful 12 V 14 Ah 
battery. 
`Sprag clutch' is a mechanism which allows the 
starter motor torque to pass through it to the crank 
shaft, when the crank shaft rpm is less than the 
motor rpm, but starts to slip once the crank shaft 
rpm is higher than the starter motor rpm. When 
the engine is started, the starter motor's torque 
will have no effect on the crank shaft. Once 
Engine is started, the battery connection to starter 
motor cuts off on releasing the starter switch. 
Battery is connected to the starter motor through 
the 'relay starter switch'. 
A conventional switch will not be in position to 
withstand very high current and hence relay 
starter switch is used. 
WORKING PRINCIPLE 
When the ignition switch is switched 'ON', 
electric supply from the relay starter is made 
available at the engine starting switch on the RH 
side of Handle bar. When this is pressed, relay 
starter is activated and it connects Battery with 
starter motor thus starting the engine.

SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM TCI SYSTEM 
TCI (TRANSISTORIZED 
COIL IGNITION) SYSTEM 
A The ICI is an advance & intelligent ignition 
system works on DC supply. It requires 7 
Volt minimum DC supply from battery to 
start the engine. 
A The principle of transistorized coil ignition 
is 'Inductive' type. 
A The TCI system has a strong spark 
intensity & long arc duration to ensure total 
combustion. 
THE TCI CONSTITUTES THE 
FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 
A Fly wheel magneto with built in reluctor 
07- 
-A Stator and Pulsar coil assembly 
TCI (positioned underneath the seat). 
-A- High inductive HT coil 
-A- Integral Rectifier and Regulator unit. 
A Battery 12V 14 Ah 
WORKING PRINCIPLE OF 
TCI 
As the crankshaft rotates, the reluctor peg inserts 
in the rotor (Permanent magnet) cuts the pulsar 
coil magnetic field & according to the law of 
induction generates voltage,which triggers 
switching of TO! unit and in turn disturbs the 
supply to primary ignition coil, thus inducing a 
high voltage in the secondary winding which 
distributed to the spark plug. The energy supplied 
to the primary coil is from the Battery. 
THE ADVANTAGES OF THE 
TCI 
A The major advantage is the spark duration 
0.7-0.8 milliseconds. This ensures 
complete combustion of the air—fuel 
mixture under all operating condition. 
-A- Improved ignition of lean mixture because 
of high intensity of spark. 
-A Good startability. 
-A Lesser electrical disturbance noise. 
A- Good battery charging even at lower RPM. 
-A Better reliability of the entire electrical 
system. 
- Maintenance free ignition system. 
-A Solid state TCI ignition avoids wear of 
contact breaker.

FUNCTIONS OF 
CARBURETOR 
CARBURETOR PERFORMS THREE 
IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS : 
1. It varies the air-fuel ratio according to the 
operating conditions and requirements of 
the engine. 
2. It produces a mixture which is properly 
atomized. Atomization is the mixing of air 
and fuel to form a fine spray or mist and to 
deliver the mixture to the engine. 
3. It regulates the amount of air - fuel mixture 
required by the engine. 
In order to meet the requirements for the 
proper mixture ratio under varying 
conditions the following systems are being 
used in Butterfly slide (BS) type 
carburetors. 
1.1 Fuel Inlet and Float System 
1.2 Starter System 
1.3 Pilot System (Slow Speed System) 
1.4 Main System (High Speed System) 
1.1. FUEL INLET AND 
FLOAT SYSTEM 
This system consists of the bowl, float and 
needle valve. Fuel from the tank enters into the 
bowl through the float system from where it is 
metered for the engine requirement. The fuel 
level in the bowl is maintained by the float system. 
The float system is a very important part of the 
main, pilot and starter circuits. The fuel level in 
the bowl must be high enough to reach them. 
But even more significantly the fuel level actually 
effects how rich or leaner the engine run through 
its entire range. A higher fuel level will richen 
mixture causing excessive fuel consumption and 
poor running. On the other hand, a low fuel level 
can be even more serious due to leaning effect it 
has. This may result in flat spot when accelerating 
out of turn or in extreme cases, the engine could 
overheat and seize. A high or low fuel level is 
due to an incorrectly adjusted float. 
The float height can be measured with the 
float bowl removed and the carburetor inverted 
with the float tongue just touching the needle 
valve. The float should be only resting and not 
compressing the spring loaded float valve needle. 
The distance "A" should be equal to the specified

float level depending on the carburetor type. This 
height can be adjusted by bending the float 
tongue. If the float height is more then the 
specification, bend the tongue away from the 
needle valve. If less than specification, bend it 
towards the needle valve. It should always be 
remembered that a high float level results in a 
low fuel level and a low float level results in a 
high fuel level. 
1.2. STARTER SYSTEM 
In addition to the air-fuel mixture problems 
of low-speed engine operation, cold engine 
starting presents yet another problem. The 
engine parts are not hot enough to vaporize the 
droplets of fuel. This additional difficulty requires 
an even richer mixture than that provided by the 
pilot system. To provide this richer mixture, a 
starter circuit is added to the carburetor. The 
starter circuit consists of a starter jet to meter 
the fuel and a plunger that opens an air passage 
from the inlet of the carburetor underneath the 
diaphragm and the mixture then passes to the 
manifold. 
The plunger is lifted by a cable or lever, As 
the plunger lifts off its seat, it uncovers a fuel 
passage that leads to the starter jet. Lifting the 
plunger further uncovers the air-inlet passage and 
the outlet to the manifold. The outlet to the venture 
is on the engine side of the throttle valve. With 
the throttle valve closed (as it should be for 
starting), almost all the air that goes to the engine 
must pass through the starter passage. This 
creates enough suction to draw fuel up from the 
bowl into the chamber below the plunger. Here 
the fuel is mixed with the air and the mixture is 
drawn into the engine. Atomization of the mixture 
is aided by an emulsion tube. This tube has holes 
drilled in the sides similar to those in the pilot jet. 
These holes allow a small amount of air from 
the float chamber to be mixed with the fuel before 
it enters the chamber below the starter plunger. 
The purpose of its atomization is to foam the fuel 
slightly allowing it to flow more easily through the 
small passage. 
1.3. PILOT SYSTEM (SLOW 
SPEED SYSTEM) 
The pilot system provides the air-fuel 
mixture at idling and at small throttle openings 
when not enough air is being drawn through the 
carburetor to cause the main system to operate. 
The pilot circuit consists of a pilot jet to meter 
fuel, two pilot air jets one located in the top part

of the carburetor body underneath the diaphragm 
and another in the inlet side near the main air jet, 
and a pilot screw to control the amount of air-fuel 
mixture flowing through the pilot outlet. 
Fuel is metered by pilot jet (PJ) and air 
volume is metered by pilot air jets (PAJ1 & PAJ2) 
and the mixture is discharged through the pilot 
outlet and bypass ports. The pilot outlet is located 
on the manifold side of the carburetor and the 
bypass ports are just covered by the butterfly 
throttle valve. Since the throttle valve is almost 
at full close, air-fuel mixture is supplied mainly 
by pilot outlet and some also from bypass port 
#1. Air-fuel mixture is adjusted by pilot screw (PS) 
and mixture becomes lean when PS is tightened 
(PS turned clockwise) and rich when it is 
loosened (PS turned anticlockwise). When the 
throttle valve is opened from idling, air-fuel 
mixture is supplied mainly from pilot outlet and 
bypass port but some is also discharged from 
main system that forms primary venture (through 
a clearance between jet needle and needle jet). 
MAIN SYSTEM 
(HIGH SPEED SYSTEM) 
This system consists of jet needle, needle 
jet and main jet to assist in atomization. An air 
bleed circuit is reincorporated in the main 
metering system and it aids fuel vaporization by 
introducing the air into the fuel before it enters 
the air stream. 
The constant velocity carburetor uses a 
butterfly throttle valve located closer to the engine 
in the carburetor body to regulate engine speed. 
The slide in a CV carburetor moves in direct 
proportion to the engine demand. This assures 
the correct venture size and air velocity 
throughout the midrange.operation of the engine. 
The constant velocity carburetor uses 
venture vacuum to control slide movement. This 
is accomplished with a rubber diaphragm that is 
attached to the top of the carburetor slide. The 
diaphragm separates two chambers. One 
chamber, below the diaphragm is vented to the 
atmospheric pressure. The other chamber, 
above the diaphragm is exposed to the venture 
air pressure by an air passage through the slide 
itself. At idle a spring keeps the slide closed. 
When the throttle valve is opened and air 
flow through the venture increases, the air 
pressure in the venture (and the upper chamber) 
decreases. As the atmospheric pressure in the 
bottom chamber is greater than the venture 
pressure above the diaphragm, the slide is 
pushed up and more air-fuel mixture is drawn 
into the engine. When the throttle valve is closed, 
air flow through the venture decreases; air 
pressure in the venture increases and 
approaches atmospheric pressure, and the 
spring pushes the slide back down. 
The midrange circuit is actually a 
combination of circuits that work together to 
achieve correct air-fuel mixture. The pilot circuit 
is still operational but its contribution to the total 
air-fuel mixtures is relatively small. The jet needle 
is a tapered needle attached to the piston valve 
which points downward, through the center of 
08-4 
carburetor venture. The tapered end of the jet 
needle fits into the needle jet broach which is 
located in the carburetor body. 
The jet needle virtually blocks the needle 
jet when the piston slide is in the closed (idle) 
position. As the slide is lifted the tapered section 
of the needle rises out of the needle jet, thus 
increasing the clearance between them and 
allowing more fuel to flow. With the piston valve 
raised, the increased airflow creates a sufficient 
pressure drop to draw more fuel from the float 
bowl and through the needle jet. At approximately 
three-quarter lift of piston valve, the clearance 
area between the jet needle and the needle jet 
becomes greater than the area of the main jet. 
At this point, the fuel flow is determined primarily 
by the size of the main jet. 
The position of the jet needle relative to the 
needle jet determines the amount of fuel flowing 
through the clearance between them, changing 
the position of the jet needle relative to the slide 
changes the air-fuel mixture. The jet needle is 
moved relative to the slide by changing the 
position of the E-ring up or down in the grooves 
on the jet needle. Moving the E-ring towards the 
top of the needle has the effect of reducing the 
fuel flow, thus leaning out the mixture. Bringing 
the E-ring towards the lower grooves will have 
the effect of richening the mixture. 
DISASSEMBLY 
A Unscrew the top cover fixing screw and 
remove the diaphragm top cover, piston 
valve spring and piston valve assembly 
from the carburetor. 
A Remove the ring and diaphragm from the 
piston valve. 
A Generally, it is not advisable to remove the 
jet needle. if it is necessary, un screw the 
jet needle fixing plate screws and remove 
the jet needle along with the jet needle 
retainer spring. 
A Unscrew the guide holder assembly by 
using the right size spanner and remove 
the plunger along with the spring. In case 
of lever type plunger assembly, it comes 
out as a single unit. 
A Unscrew the mixture control screw along 
with its spring, plate washer and o-ring. 
A Unscrew the float body fixing screws and 
remove the float body from the mixing body. 
A If it is absolutely necessary, unscrew the 
float toggle pin retaining spring and remove 
the float along with the needle valve. 
A Unscrew the pilot jet, main jet and main jet 
holder from the mixing body. 
'Remove the needle jet from the mixing 
body only if it is necessary. 
A Unscrew the drain screw from the float 
body. 
A Unscrew the pilot air jets from the mixing 
body if required. 
ASSEMBLING PROCEDURE 
A Follow the reverse sequence of 
disassembling procedure. 
A While assembling the jet needle ensure that 
the jet needle ring pin coincides with the 
corresponding hole in piston valve. 
A When fixing the needle jet ensure that the 
correct concentricity to main jet holder hole 
is maintained.

MAINTENANCE TIPS 
A The maintenance of the carburetor is 
merely a question of cleaning periodically 
in order to avoid blockage of jets and 
channels. 
A Maintaining a full tank of petrol doesn't allow 
fuel tank to rust and there by reduces rust 
deposits in the carburetors. 
A Drain the carburetor every three thousand 
Kms by removing the drain screw to drain 
all the deposits at the bottom of the float 
bowl. 
A When using the choke do not open the 
throttle as it may cause flooding. 
A Clean Air-filter regularly, as a blocked or 
damaged air-filter will have an adverse 
effect on both the carburetor as well as the 
engine performance. 
SERVICE GUIDELINES 
A Spray carburetor cleaner in all passages 
to ensure that there is no blockage due to 
dust, dirt, gum or carbon deposit, especially 
in the main air passage, pilot air passages, 
including by-pass holes and pilot outlet. 
-A While re-assembling dismantled 
carburetors, always replace the old 
gaskets and o-ring with new ROYAL 
ENFIELD genuine spares. 
A Cleaning of jets should be done only with 
the help of carburetor cleaner and 
compressed air. 
A 
Check the float height and ensure that it is 
as per specifications. 
Ensure that the pilot jet is not tightened 
beyond the specified torque as this will 
cause the head to shear and removal of 
the jet from the mixing body becomes 
nearly impossible. 
08-6 
• Do not tamper with the e-ring position of 
the jet needle or change the sizes of the 
jets in order to attain better mileage or 
power as this will have adverse effect on 
the engine performance and lead to pre-mature 
wear of engine parts. 
Always use genuine parts, of the right 
specifications, - for replacements. 
?h Tighten all screws & jets to the right 
specifications. 
Ensure that the seating area of the choke 
plunger assembly is not worn or damaged. 
If worn or damaged, replace the plunger 
assembly.

for about 4 kms. 
A The idling speed can be adjusted only with 
the idling screw. 
-A If there is a performance deterioration, 
clean carburetor and adjust the idling 
speed. 
NOTE : 
Before adjusting the idling speed, correct the free 
play of cable assembly throttle to 1-2mm. 
ADJUST THE IDLING SPEED AS 
FOLLOWS: 
A Warm up the engine adequately and set 
the idling screw so that the engine runs at 
a higher rpm than its idling specification . 
-A Now turn the pilot screw in & out and select 
a position where the engine rpm reaches 
the maximum. Normally this will occur 
between 1 to 4 turns of pilot screw from 
full close position. 
A Now adjust the idle screw to bring down 
the engine revolution to the specified idle 
rpm. 
A After adjusting the idling rpm check the 
CO% and readjust the pilot screw if 
necessary. 
Warmup the measuring instrument as per 
the equipment manufacturer's 
recommendations, before carrying out the 
measurements. 
A Examine the Muffler Assembly for any 
leakage. If any leakage noticed, ensure to 
arrest the leakage before measurement of 
CO. 
A Set the idling speed (900 ± 100 rpm) as 
explained in chapter "Periodic 
Maintenance" of the vehicle manual. 
Fix a separate special tube made of silicon 
rubber to the Body Complete Muffler and 
tighten its clamp screw. 
A Insert the sample probe of analyser atleast 
600mm inside special tube to prevent the 
dilution of exhaust sample with the air. 
08=8 
WORKING PRINCIPLE OF 
SECONDARY AIR VALVE 
• The exhaust of the engine consists of three 
polluting gasses namely carbon monoxide 
(CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of 
nitrogen. For controlling CO and HC, 
oxidation reaction has to be promoted. The 
secondary air valve provides the oxygen 
required for oxidation reaction. 
-A The exhaust of the engine will have positive 
and negative pressure pulses. Utilising 
these negative pressure pulses, air is 
drawn from the air cleaner and admitted in 
to the exhaust through a reed valve. When 
there is a positive pressure, reed closes 
and prevents exhaust from entering the 
system. 
.A The air suction valve is provided with air 
cut valve system to cut-off the air supply 
during acceleration to prevent after burn. 
TROUBLE SHOOTING 
-A The only method of verifying the functioning 
of ASV is to compare the vehicle exhaust 
CO% at idle condition with and without the 
ASV.

GAS FILLED SHOCK 
ABSORBER 
WORKING PRINCIPLE 
A The pressure of the nitrogen/Air, in the 
reserve tube of a gas charged shock 
varies from 75 to 120 psi, depending on 
the amount of fluid in the reserve tube. The 
gas serves several important functions to 
improve the ride control characteristics of 
the shock absorbers. 
-A The main function is to increase the 
resistance of fluid flow into the reserve tube. 
This improves valving performance during 
the beginning of rebound stroke. 
-A- Another function is to minimize aeration of 
the shock absorber's hydraulic fluid. The 
pressure of the nitrogen gas / air prevents 
air bubbles or foam from weakening the 
hydraulic effectiveness of fluid flow through 
both the piston and base valve systems. 
Foam affects performance since foam 
compresses, fluid does not. This is 
alternatively called as cavitation. The effect 
of foaming will result in poor riding 
comfort.

CHARGING 
INTIAL CHARGE : 
ELECTROLYTE : 
Dilute sulphuric acid with distilled water to 
a specific gravity of 1.240 
PREPARATION : 
-A Take required distilled water in a glass / 
plastic container 
-A Slowly, add sulphuric acid to it. 
eemeaft 
It is important to ensure that the sulphuric 
acid is added into the distilled water and 
not vice versa. Stir and check the specific 
gravity of electrolyte and add sulphuric acid 
will the specific gravity becomes 1.240 
Stir with a glass rod 
-A Check the specific gravity with hydrometer. 
TEMPERATURE OF ELECTROLYTE : 
Cool the electrolyte to about 30 deg. C 
before filling it in the battery upto the 
maximum level indicated. 
SOAKING PERIOD: 
-A Keep the battery with electrolyte filled for 
about half an hour before commencement 
of charging. Top up the level with electrolyte 
if necessary. 
-A Then put them on charge. 
Battery Duration Charging Current 
12V 14AH 10Hrs 1.4 Amps 
RECHARGING: 
RECHARGE A USED BATTERY 
A when the specific gravity of electrolyte is 
less than 1.220. 
-A when a charged battery remains unused 
for more than 3 weeks. 
eacceectit

• Protect from sunlight, heat, rain and dust. 
• Keep exhaust seal cap in place to avoid 
deterioration of dry charge properties 
A- Fresh dry charged batteries need initial 
charging duration of 8 to 10 hours - Upto 
3 months from the date of manufacturing. 
A- Beyond 3 months the batteries may need 
extended duration of initial charging subject 
to storage conditions. 
-A Charged batteries, if kept idle shall be boost 
charged once in 3 to 4 weeks 
.A It is always a good practice to boost charge 
the batteries before fitment to ensure full 
state of charge. 
• Recharge stored batteries once a month. 
Check the terminals and cables for 
corrosion. Apply petroleum jelly on 
terminals to prevent corrosion.

BATTERY PROBLEMS 
SULPHATION 
The active materials in the plates are 
converted into lead sulphate during 
discharge. This lead sulphate is 
reconverted to active materials during 
recharge. If the battery remains in 
discharged condition for long periods or 
excess quantity of acid is used in the 
electolyte, the lead sulphate is converted 
to hard crystalline substance. This is 
sulphation. 
Sulphated batteries donot take normal 
charging i.e, during charging the lead 
sulphate will not get reconverted to active 
materials. such batteries may show normal 
voltage without load, but donot not take 
load. 
HYDRATION 
The positive and negative plates remain 
submerged in electrolyte. However, when 
electrolyte level is less than the minimum 
indicate, the active materials on the palte 
get exposed to atmospheric air. The active 
materials, then reacts with water vapour 
of the atmosphedre, forming white spots 
on the plate. This is hydration. 
Hydration reduces the active area on the 
plates for chemical reaction. This battery 
capacity. 
SHEDDING 
The active materials of the plates falling off 
is shedding . Over charging and rough 
handling are the main cause buckling 
plates, rendering the battery unserviceable. 
Over charging means charging of the 
battery with excessive current. 
COMMON PROBLEM 
EXPERIENCED IN FIELD 
A. CORROSION OF POSITIVE GRIDS 
- CAUSES 
A- Improper Impurities in water/ acid [like CI, 
Mn, Fc.] 
INDICATIONS 
-A setting of voltage and current regulator 
leading to overcharging / undercharging 
A Operating at high temperature 
A Too frequent topping up 
A Abnormal rise in electrolyte temperature

EFFECT 
A Positive plates gets heavily corroded 
becomes weak and disintegrate 
A Water in the electrolyte decomposer into 
hydrogen and oxygen and the electrolyte 
becomes concentrated 
A Separator gets damaged due to high 
temperature and impurities. 
CORRECTIVE ACTION 
-A Replace RR Unit 
A Not to use local spurious rectifiers 
-A Usage of only battery grade distilled water/ 
DM water for top up. 
A Usage of battery grade acid for filling 
B. SULPHATION - CAUSES 
A Deep discharge 
A Lack of charge due to low regulator setting 
A Self discharge due to idling 
11-6 
A Low electrolyte level 
A Impurities like Fe, Cu, Mn. 
INDICATIONS 
-A Decrease in capacity indicated by weak 
horn and dim lights 
A Lower cell voltage 
A Lower specific gravity 
-A Milky electrolyte colour 
-A Increase in self discharge due to (a) 
Impurities, (b) Idling 
A Plates at the top getting exposed and 
sulphated. 
EFFECTS 
A Formation of sulphates in the plates 
A Sulphation causes hardening of plates 
A Treeing / shorting through separator 
A The plates exposed get sulphated and 
hardened and become active. 
CORRECTIVE ACTION 
Replace RR unit 
A Periodical check up of battery for bench 
charging 
A- Usage of battery grade acid for filling 
A Usage of battery grade distilled water/ DM 
water for topping up. 
-A Periodic topping up to prevent exposure of 
plates. 
A If the battery is idle for longer duration to 
boost charge before reuse to compensate 
for self discharge. 
SPARK PLUG 
Spark Plug is a vital part of ignition system. 
They are subjected to high combustion 
pressure (arounf 40 times the atmospheric 
pressure), intense heat (more than 2000 
deg. C. temperature) and severe vibration. 
Use of specified spark plug is therefore 
very important for good performance of an 
engine. 
Specification : Bosch W3CC 
HEAT RANGE 
The spark plug is selected such that its 
electrodes with stand the operating 
temperatures of the engine - hot enough 
to prevent fouling but cold enough to avoid 
auto ignition. 
HOT PLUG 
Spark plug with8 large insulator tip surface 
area. Central electrode remain hotter. 
COLD PLUG 
Spark plug with less insulator tip surface 
central electrode cools faster. 
Vehicle Usage Spark plug 
recommended 
1. Normal driving, 
both in city and 
highway 
Normal 
recommendation 
2. Mostly stop and 
go city driving 
Use hotter plug 
3. Mostly heavy 
loading, 
sustained high 
speed 
Use colder plug. 
SPARK PLUG ELECTRODE

SPARK PLUG 
MAINTENANCE 
-A Neglecting the spark plug maintenance 
eventually leads to difficult starting and poor 
performance. If the spark is used for a long 
period, the electrode gradually burns away 
and carbon builds up along the inside part. 
Once in 3000 kms or earlier, the plug 
should be removed for inspection, cleaning 
and resetting the gap. 
-A Carbon deposits on the spark plug 
establishes a 'shunt' between center and 
earth electrodes, that prevents good 
sparking and causes misfiring. Clean the 
deposits off periodically, with a spark plug 
cleaning tool / machine. 
Check spark plug for worn out the earth 
and center electrodes. If the earth electrode 
has worn off to a knife edge and center 
electrode has reduced in height, replace it 
with new. 
Check spark plug for worn out earth and center

b. No smoke with rocker oil pipe in place go to check 3 
12-6 
NOTES: 
A- Failure of return pump causes excessive 
oil accumulation in crank case throughout 
engine operation. The fly wheels dip though 
it. Excessive splash thus caused ends up 
with oil entry to combustion chamber and 
white smoke. 
METHOD OF CHECKING OIL 
CIRCULATION 
A Open the oil tank cap. Keep the engine low 
idling. The sound of oil flow to the tank, 
indicates oil circulation. 
-A- Remove the tappet inspection door. 
Continuous oil flow through the push rod 
tunnel while the engine is in operation 
indicates proper oil circulation. 
A- Loosen the banjo union at the cylinder head 
while the engine running in low idle. Oil flow 
from this joint indicates proper oil 
circulation upto this point. 
WHITE SMOKE 
Lubricating oil leakage to combustion 
chamber shows up as white smoke. 
Lubrication oil can enter the combustion 
chamber from: 
A The top through valve, valve guide and 
cylinder head. 
The bottom between cylinder bore and 
piston rings. 
Check to find out whether the oil enters the 
combustion chamber from the top or 
bottom: 
'A Remove the rocker oil pipe banjos (two 
nos) and bend the pipe away from the 
engine. 
A Keep a clean tray below the pipe. 
Start and run the engine. 
A If white smoke stops, the oil enters the 
combustion chamber from the top. 
-A- If white smoke continues, the oil entry to 
the combustion chamber is from the 
bottom. 
CHECK FOR OIL LEAKAGE AT VALVE 
GUIDE: 
A Open the rocker cover. 
A Start and warm up the engine. 
A Keep the engine at 1500 rpm. 
A- Pour some engine oil on to the valve. 
-A Observe the smoke. 
A Increased white smoke indicates oil leak 
between valve and valve guides. 
CHECK FOR OIL LEAKAGE 
BETWEEN CYLINDER BORE AND 
PISTON RINGS: 
A Remove the cylinder head. 
A Clean and dry the piston top. 
A- Crank the engine several times and check 
for oil seepage from the bottom onto the 
piston crown. 
A Oil seepage onto the piston crown indicates 
oil leakage from bottom between cylinder 
bore and piston rings.
